These appliques can also be used to simply add an aesthetic appeal to the dial.

Typically, these appliques are mounted on the dial by successive bonding and optionally masking and/or stamping steps which, in addition to the cost of the appliques, leads to additional manufacturing costs due to the required positioning accuracy, which is all the greater the thicker the applique is.

The present disclosure is directed to photonic assembly/testing and, more specifically, to a method of aligning an optical component with an on-chip port.

BACKGROUND

Photonic packaging is the assembly procedure which allows optical chips to be encapsulated in reliable protection packages providing electrical and optical interfaces between the photonic chip and the user. Photonic packaging can rely on the experience of the electronics industry to successfully implement several assembly functions, however, the optical connection between functional optical components requires submicron-scale alignment and represents a new critical assembly challenge.

Optical fibers are often used to create connectivity between different optical chips/modules. The efficient connection between a single on-chip port and an optical fibre requires submicron scale and controlled alignment, commonly performed by means of micro-manipulators. Connectivity with a photonic chip with multiple ports can be established through an array of optical fibers, which is commercially available as a single device containing pre-aligned optical fibres.

Efficient alignment between the on-chip ports (perfectly aligned) and the array of optical fibers is compromised by the imperfect position of each fiber core in the array, therefore, alternative solutions are required. This motivates the investigation of efficient methods for the alignment of multiple optical fibres with multiport photonic chips.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

It would be advantageous to achieve an apparatus for aligning an optical component with a further optical component.

In a first aspect, there is provided an apparatus arranged for deflecting an optical component for alignment purposes of the optical component with a further optical component, wherein the apparatus comprises a plurality of adjacently placed elongate carriers, extending mutually parallel in a longitudinal direction, wherein two adjacently placed elongate carriers have a spacing between them for receiving a first optical component such that the received optical component rests against two adjacently placed elongate carriers, wherein these two elongate carriers have slopes such that the spacing between these two adjacently placed elongate carriers is smaller at a bottom side compared to the spacing at a top side of the carriers, wherein the carriers comprise piezoelectric material such that the carriers can be deflected in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction by actuating the piezoelectric material.

The above is thus related to a piezoelectric system which enables simultaneous and two dimensional alignment of optical components like optical fibers, mechanically independently. The piezoelectric system may, for example, consist of an array of bimorph piezoelectric cantilevers with a pitch of 250 μm, which can be independently controlled. Two adjacent cantilevers are employed to achieve two dimensional alignment of a single optical fiber. Alignment is achieved by electronically deflecting, through for example voltage based effects, the tips of the two cantilevers.

In accordance with the present disclosure, the two adjacently placed elongate carriers have a spacing between them for receiving the optical component such that the received optical component rests against the two adjacently placed elongate carriers. This is accomplished by the features that the two elongate carriers have slopes such that the spacing between these two adjacently placed elongate carriers is smaller at the bottom side compare to the spacing at the top side.

In other words, the wall of a carrier is not, in use, completely vertical. The wall may be construed in such a way that the width of the carrier varies gradually from the top side to the bottom side. This has the effect that a received optical component can be displaced, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, by moving the corresponding carriers independently.

Two options exist for moving the received optical component.

First, the carriers may be deflected, independently from each other, in a vertical direction. Second, the carriers may be deflected, independently from each other, in a horizontal direction.

For example, deflecting the carriers towards each other has the effect that the received optical component is moved upwards. Deflecting both carriers to one side has the effect that the received optical component is moved to that particular side. Deflecting the carriers away from each other has the effect that the received optical component is moved downwards.

In other words, in an example, a piezoelectric system may be provided, which enables simultaneous and two-dimensional alignment of optical fibers, mechanically independent and, for example, spaced by 500 μm. According to one example, a piezoelectric system is provided that includes an array of bimorph piezoelectric cantilevers, being the carriers, with a pitch of 250 μm, which can be independently controlled.

Two adjacent cantilevers are employed to achieve two-dimensional alignment of a single optical fiber. Each optical fiber is placed between the tips of two adjacent piezoelectric cantilevers, which can be electronically deflected, through voltage based effects, to push the optical fiber. When voltage is applied between the top and bottom surfaces of a piezoelectric cantilever, bending of the cantilever and subsequent deflection of the free standing tip occur by piezoelectric effects in a bimorph structure.

All the employed piezoelectric cantilevers may have a bottom and a top electrode. The bottom electrodes may electrically be connected through short circuit while the top electrodes are electrically insulated and can be independently controlled and contacted through either an electrical probe array or wire bonding.

It is noted that the piezoelectric materials may be broadly classified as crystalline, ceramic and polymeric piezoelectric materials. The carriers may thus comprise piezoelectric ceramics being lead zirconate titanate, PZT, barium titanate and lead titanate.

It is further noted that the apparatus is directed to the alignment process of aligning an optical component with a further optical component. For example, a particular optical fibre may be aligned with an on-chip port, wherein the optical fibre is received in a space between two carriers. Another option is that an optical lens is aligned with an on-chip port of an integrated circuit, IC. Yet another option is that two optical fibres are aligned with each other. In the latter, even two apparatuses may be used, one for each optical fibre, which is explained in more detail later below.

It is even further noted that the received optical component, for example an optical fibre, may protrude, i.e. extent, from the carriers itself, in the longitudinal direction. The optical fibre may thus stick out. This has the beneficial effect that the carrier may be adequately fixated using the portion that sticks out from the apparatus.

In an example, the two elongate carriers have slopes such that the side walls of these two adjacently placed elongate carriers form a V- or curved shaped groove supporting the received optical component. The side wall of a carrier may be formed such that the thickness of the carrier gradually reduces from bottom side to top side, thereby enabling a received optical fibre to be moved in two dimensions.

In an example, each of the elongate carriers has a slope of between 8-50 degrees.

Ideally, the carriers may have a slope of around 45 degrees to ensure that there is quite a bit of freedom of movement in both the horizontal and vertical direction. This further reduces the frictional resistance that a received optical component experiences.

In a further example, the elongate carriers are smoothened for reducing frictional resistance between the received optical component and the corresponding elongate carriers.

In the context of this disclosure, smoothening may encompass different steps. For example, the elongate carriers may be coated with a smoothening material for reducing frictional resistance between the received optical component and the corresponding elongate carriers. Another option is that the elongate carriers are polished. Yet another option is that the elongate carriers are exposed to a chemical process for increasing the smoothness thereof.

In other words, the smoothening step may encompass reducing the surface roughness of the carriers, wherein the surface roughness may be defined as the measure of the finely spaced micro-irregularities on the surface texture.

The above described smoothening material may be any of a silicon nitride material, or a silicon dioxide material, or any insulating material which can be deposited through chemical deposition or sputtering techniques.

In a further example, the carriers can be deflected in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction by applying a voltage to the carriers.

That is, the carriers can be deflected in the direction perpendicular to the plane on which the carriers are resting by applying a voltage to the carriers.

In a further example, two adjacently placed elongate carriers have a spacing between them for receiving the optical component being any of an optical fibre and an optical lens.

The inventors have found that multiple types of optical components may be aligned with the on-chip port, like an optical fibre and an optical lens.

The spacing between adjacently placed elongate carriers may between 100-400 μm.

The advantage hereof is that the spacing may be tailored to the spacing of the ports of an integrated circuit.

The length of the carriers, seen in the longitudinal direction, may be between 1 cm-5 cm.

The apparatus may, for example, comprise a base part, wherein each of the carriers extent, from the base part, in the longitudinal direction. The apparatus may resemble a comb, wherein the carriers are not directly connected to each other at their tips for ensuring that the carriers are able to deflect independently from each other. The carriers may be connected to each other at the other end, via a base part. The length of the carriers may be somewhere between 1 cm-5 cm such that the required deflection in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction may be obtained.

In a further example, each of the elongate carriers has a side wall slope resembling any of:a linear slope;a curved slope; anda step shaped slope.

In another example, adjacently placed elongate carriers have a spacing between them for receiving the optical component such that the received optical component rests against two adjacently placed elongate carriers, and wherein the spacing between the next adjacently placed elongate carrier is free from receiving an optical component.

In accordance with the invention, the optical component may be received in the space between two adjacent carriers. However, the apparatus is also foreseen for the embodiment that a fibre is placed on top of the carrier. In that particular case, the fibre can be moved in one direction only, i.e. only horizontally or vertically. This, because in such a way it's not possible to utilize the slope of the side wall of a carrier for deflecting the optical fibre in a second direction.

The advantage of the above is that the pitch, i.e. the distance between subsequent carriers, can be reduced allowing the apparatus to be used in more versatile situations.

In a second aspect, there is provided a system for aligning an on-chip port of a first chip with an on-chip port of a second chip, wherein the system comprises:a first apparatus in accordance with any of the previous examples for aligning the on-chip port of the first chip with a first optical component;a second apparatus in accordance with any of the previous examples for aligning the on-chip port of the second chip with a second optical component, such that the on-chip port of the first chip is aligned with the on-chip port of the second chip via the respective first and second optical components.

It is noted that the advantages as disclosed with the first aspect of the disclosure, being the apparatus, are also applicable to the second aspect of the disclosure, being the system.

In a third aspect, there is provided a method for aligning an optical component with an on-chip port using an apparatus in accordance with any of the previous examples, wherein the method comprises the steps of:receiving, in a space between two adjacently placed elongate carriers, an optical component;deflecting the two adjacently placed elongate carriers for aligning the optical component with an on-chip port by actuating the piezoelectric material of the two adjacently placed elongate carriers.

In an example, the step of deflecting comprises:deflecting the two adjacently placed elongate carriers for aligning the optical component with an on-chip port by applying voltage to the piezoelectric material of the two adjacently placed elongate carriers.

In a further example, the elongate carriers are coated with a smoothening material for reducing frictional resistance between the received optical component and the corresponding elongate carriers.

The above mentioned and other features and advantages of the disclosure will be best understood from the following description referring to the attached drawings. In the drawings, like reference numerals denote identical parts or parts performing an identical or comparable function or operation.

Particular embodiments relate to wireless communication, and more specifically to enhanced cell ranking based on a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning information.

BACKGROUND

Generally, all terms used herein are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning in the relevant technical field, unless a different meaning is clearly given and/or is implied from the context in which it is used. All references to a/an/the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc. are to be interpreted openly as referring to at least one instance of the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc., unless explicitly stated otherwise. The steps of any methods disclosed herein do not have to be performed in the exact order disclosed, unless a step is explicitly described as following or preceding another step and/or where it is implicit that a step must follow or precede another step. Any feature of any of the embodiments disclosed herein may be applied to any other embodiment, wherever appropriate. Likewise, any advantage of any of the embodiments may apply to any other embodiments, and vice versa. Other objectives, features, and advantages of the enclosed embodiments will be apparent from the following description.

Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) includes specifications for the Evolved Packet System (EPS). EPS is based on the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) radio network and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). It was originally intended to provide voice and mobile broadband (MBB) services but has continuously evolved to broaden its functionality. 3GPP LTE also includes narrowband Internet-of-things (NB-IoT) and LTE for machine type communication (LTE-M) and provides connectivity to massive machine type communications (mMTC) services.

3GPP Release 15 includes the first release of fifth generation (5G) networks. 5G is the next generation radio access technology which provides services such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) and mMTC. 5G can be based on the New Radio (NR) access stratum interface and the 5G Core Network (5GC). NR Release 15 supports operation in a set of new frequency bands in the range 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz. The NR physical and higher layers reuse parts of the LTE specification and add needed components when motivated by the new services.

3GPP Release 15 also includes preparation for NR operation in a non-terrestrial network (NTN) (3GPP TR 38.811). Release 16 includes additional NTN features. In parallel, LTE may also be adapted to operate in NTN. For example, LTE-M and NB-IoT may operate in an NTN.

A satellite radio access network usually includes a satellite (i.e., a space-borne platform), an earth-based gateway that connects the satellite to a base station or a core network, depending on the choice of architecture, a feeder link (i.e., the link between a gateway and a satellite), and a service link (i.e., the link between a satellite and a user equipment (UE)).

Two popular architectures are the bent pipe transponder and the regenerative transponder architectures. In the first case the base station is located on earth behind the gateway, and the satellite operates as a repeater forwarding the feeder link signal to the service link, and vice versa. In the second case the satellite is in the base station and the service link connects it to the earth-based core network.

Depending on the orbit altitude, a satellite may be categorized as low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), or geostationary (GEO) satellite. LEO typically includes heights ranging from 250-1,500 km and orbital periods ranging from 90-120 minutes. MEO typically includes heights ranging from 5,000-25,000 km and orbital periods ranging from 3-15 hours. GEO typically includes a height at about 35,786 km and an orbital period of 24 hours.

Propagation delay is one of the main physical properties in a satellite communication system that makes the design different from that of a terrestrial mobile system. For a bent pipe satellite network, the round-trip time (RTT) may, based on the orbit height, range from tens of ms in the case of LEO to several hundreds of ms for GEO. For comparison, the round-trip delays in a cellular network are limited to 1 ms.

To handle the large RTT in a NR based NTN, one technique is to equip each device with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. The GNSS receiver enables a device to estimate its position and the universal time (UTC). The UE can also be pre-loaded (and updated when necessary) with the ephemeris of the satellite constellation which can be theoretical or actual, and feeder link delay information. The GNSS equipped UE can compute the position and motion of the possible serving satellites to determine the propagation delay (and delay variation, Doppler shift and variation rate, etc.). In addition to position and time, the velocity of the device can be obtained by measuring the Doppler shift of the GPS signal, or by measuring the variation of the position over an extended period of time.

A communication satellite typically generates several beams over a given area. The footprint of a beam is usually in an elliptic shape, which traditionally is referred to as a cell. The footprint of a beam may also be referred to as a spotbeam. The footprint of a beam may move over the earth's surface with the satellite movement or may be earth fixed with some beam pointing mechanism used by the satellite to compensate for its motion. The size of a spotbeam depends on the system design, which may range from tens of kilometers to a few thousands of kilometers.

FIG.1is a block diagram illustrating an example architecture of a satellite network with bent pipe transponders. Base station160is located on earth behind satellite gateway12. Satellite gateway12transmits a signal from base station160over the feeder link to satellite14. Satellite14operates as a repeater forwarding the feeder link signal to the access link to wireless device110. Signals are transmitted for wireless device110to base station160in the reverse directions.

The NTN beam may in comparison to the beams observed in a terrestrial network be very wide and cover an area outside of the area defined by the served cell. Beams covering adjacent cells will overlap and make idle and connected mode mobility based on received signal strength (RSRP) measurements challenging.

A GNSS receiver determines the travel time of a signal from a satellite by comparing the pseudo random code the receiver generates with an identical code in the signal from the satellite. The receiver “slides” its code later and later in time until it synchronizes with the satellite's code. The amount that the GNSS receiver must slide the code is equal to the signal's travel time. The code measurements are precise to a meter level accuracy.

The carrier phase measurement is a measure of the range between a satellite and receiver expressed in units of cycles of the carrier frequency. This measurement can be made with very high precision (of the order of millimeters), but the whole number of cycles between satellite and receiver is not measurable. Therefore, the device needs assistance information from a reference ground station with known location in the vicinity of the device. Combining information from a reference ground station and carrier phase measurements can improve the GNSS location to a centimeter accuracy.

Cell ranking R in a NR, NB-IoT or LTE network is based on RSRP measurement quantity. For example, the cell-ranking criterion Rsfor serving cell in NR is given by

Rs=Qm⁢eas,s+Qhyst-Qoffsettemp

where Qmeas,sis the RSRP measurement quantity for serving cell, Qhystspecifies the hysteresis value for ranking criteria, and Qoffsettempspecifies the additional offset to be used for cell selection and reselection. It is temporarily used in case the RRC Connection Establishment fails on the cell.

The cell-ranking criterion Rnfor a neighboring cell in NR is given by

Rn=Qm⁢e⁢a⁢s,n-Qoffset-Qoffsettemp

where Qmeas,nis the RSRP measurement quantity for neighboring cell, and Qoffset specifies the additional offset. For intra-frequency, if Qoffsets,nthat specifies the offset between the two cells is valid, Qoffset is equal to Qoffsets,n; otherwise, Qoffset is equal to zero. For inter-frequency, if Qoffsets,nis valid, Qoffset is equal to Qoffsets,n+Qoffsetfrequencywhere Qoffsetfrequencyspecifies specific offset for equal priority NR frequencies; otherwise, Qoffset is equal to Qoffsetfrequency. A UE uses the R values to rank all cells that fulfill the cell selection criterion and perform cell reselection to the highest ranked cell (unless the cell is found to be not-suitable).

To better support multi-beam operations in NR cells, a UE can measure RSRP quantities for all synchronization signal block (SSB) beams in an NR cell. If nrofSS-BlocksToAverage and absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation are configured and the highest SSB beam measurement quantity value is larger than absThreshSS-Blocks Consolidation, the cell measurement quantity is the linear average of the power values of up to nrofSS-BlocksToAverage of highest beam measurement quantity values above absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation. Otherwise, the RSRP measurement quantity for the highest SSB beam is used as the measurement quantity of the corresponding cell.

For cell reselection, if rangeToBestCell is configured, among the cells whose R value is within rangeToBestCell of the R value of the highest ranked cell, the UE performs cell reselection to the cell that has the highest number of beams above the threshold absThreshSS-Blocks Consolidation. If multiple cells tie, the UE performs cell reselection to the highest ranked cell among the multiple cells.

It may be advantageous for devices in NTN to use location-based mobility. A device equipped with a GNSS receiver may, instead of using RSRP measurements for mobility, base its mobility on its geographical position relative to a set of well-defined geographical positions, such as corresponding to the cell centers in the NTN, or other examples as described with respect toFIG.2.

FIG.2illustrates reference locations associated with a spot beam (e.g., cell centers). The horizontal axis represents longitude and the vertical axis represents latitude. UE110is illustrated at a geographical position with respect to cell centers P1, P2, P3, P4and P5.

There currently exist certain challenges. For conventional cell reselection, a UE performs a ranking of neighboring cells and selects to the highest ranked cell. The ranking is often performed based on measured signal strength assisted by a prioritization among the neighboring cells. Thus, 3GPP systems base the cell reselection ranking metric on signal strength measurements and do not consider NTN specific aspects. One aspect is that RSRP measurements across a set of multiple cells in an NTN network may display limited signal level variations because of the geometry in satellite networks as well as the slow signal drop-off in spotbeam antenna patterns. This makes it difficult to base a reliable cell reselection ranking entirely on RSRP.

The present invention relates to facial recognition systems, and, more particularly, to identifying and bolstering weaknesses in facial recognition systems.

Description of the Related Art

Facial recognition systems are widespread and used in a number of different contexts. However, while facial recognition has proven successful in many different real-world applications, they may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations on the input can mislead these systems. Such vulnerabilities can cause severe damage in high-security applications.

SUMMARY

A method for evaluating and enhancing a neural network model includes constructing a surrogate model that corresponds to a target neural network model, based on a degree of knowledge about the target neural network model. Adversarial attacks against the surrogate model are generated, based on an attack goal, a level of attacker capability, and an attack model. The target neural network model is tested for accuracy under the generated adversarial attacks to determine a degree of robustness of the target neural network. Robustness of the target neural network model is enhanced by replacing facial occlusions in input images before applying the input images to the target neural network.

A method of evaluating and enhancing a neural network model includes constructing an ensemble of surrogate models that correspond to a target neural network model, based on lack of attacker knowledge about a structure of the target neural network model. Adversarial attacks against the surrogate model are generated, according to multiple different sets of assumptions about an attack goal, a level of attacker capability, and an attack model, by solving optimization problems that correspond to different respective combinations of attack model and attack goal. The target neural network model is tested for accuracy under the generated adversarial attacks to determine a degree of robustness of the target neural network. Robustness of the target neural network model is enhanced by replacing facial occlusions in input images before applying the input images to the target neural network.

A system for evaluating and enhancing a neural network model includes a hardware processor and a memory that stores a computer program product. When executed by the hardware processor, the computer program product causes the hardware processor to construct a surrogate model that corresponds to a target neural network model, based on a degree of knowledge about the target neural network model, to generate adversarial attacks against the surrogate model, based on an attack goal, a level of attacker capability, and an attack model, to test the target neural network model for accuracy under the generated adversarial attacks to determine a degree of robustness of the target neural network, and to generate an occlusion replacer that replaces facial occlusions in input images before applying the input images to the target neural network.

These and other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.

11986559	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to the field of coating pharmaceutical substrates. In particular, the invention relates to a method of coating of pharmaceutical substrates and a method of making a pharmaceutical formulation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many tablets today are coated after being pressed. Coating is used to surround or coat a pharmaceutically active ingredient or drug by at least one layer of a surface. Coating is used for recognition, for purposes of masking the taste, or for controlled release purposes to change dissolution properties of active agent. Coating can also been used to work as a barrier against atmospheric stress e.g. humidity, UV-light and oxygen to increase physical and chemical stability of the active agent.

Various methods of coating pharmaceuticals or medical devices are known. Modern tablet coatings are polymer and polysaccharide based, with plasticizers and pigments included. The tablet coating process is complex, and involves parameters such as the spray pattern, drop size, and nozzle spacing, in addition to multiple other non-spray related parameters which must all be precisely controlled in order to ensure uniform distribution of the coating material.

Prior art discloses several methods for coating or encapsulating pharmaceuticals. WO9002546 discloses microencapsulated pharmaceuticals, which are formed by vapor depositing a polymeric film around a core comprising an active pharmaceutical agent to provide effective controlled release activity. DE 10307568 discloses membranes useful in pharmaceutical industry, which have reduced diameter micro- or nanopores produced by coating film with etched or laser produced openings. US 2010/0297251 discloses a method of encapsulating an active pharmaceutical agent with a controlled release coating layer using a gas phase chemical vapor deposition process. The coating materials used are monomers or carbonaceous compounds that upon polymerization yield polymers or polymer films that are degradable or nondegradable. US2009/0186968 discloses atomic plasma deposited coatings over a drug attached to a porous metal substrate. The method is applicable on drugs attached or adhering to a stent surface.

Pharmaceutical industry has a great desire to reduce costs and find new approaches for drug manufacturing and drug delivery. Current approaches of preparing pharmaceutical formulations and pharmaceutical dosage forms are complex, involve a number of technical steps, require special additives or treatments and result in pharmaceutical products with poor stability. In addition, most methods result in low product yields, due, in part, to the limited tolerance of the starting materials to industrial operating conditions and the numerous technical difficulties associated with the coating process. Especially challenging is the dissolution and controlled delivery of poorly soluble pharmaceuticals. Undoubtedly, there is a need for more efficient methods which improve processing techniques and processability of drugs which have poor flow properties and lack of compressibility. Moreover, there remains a need of developing a robust process of preparing pharmaceutical formulations which can be directly processed into the final dosage forms.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

An object of the present invention is thus to provide a method so as to solve the above problems. In particular, the object of the present invention is to provide an advantageous method for coating pharmaceuticals, which improves processability of drugs having poor flow properties and lack of compressibility. In addition, the object of the present invention is to provide an effective method for making a pharmaceutical formulation.

The objects of the application are achieved by a method wherein a layer of protective material is applied on the surface of a pharmaceutical substrate using an ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) method or other corresponding technology. The objects of the application are further achieved by a method of making a pharmaceutical formulation, wherein the pharmaceutical substrate is first coated by ALD, an optional mixture of the coated substrate and excipients is formed and thereafter processed into a desired dosage form in which solid pharmaceutical particles are utilized. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical formulation obtained by the method. Additionally, the objects of the application are achieved by a pharmaceutical formulation consisting of individual pharmaceutical particles wherein each individual particle comprises an active pharmaceutical agent and wherein each individual particle is coated by ALD method. The present invention also relates to the use of the ALD method or other corresponding technology for coating a pharmaceutical substrate.

The preferred embodiments of this invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.

The inventors of the present application surprisingly noticed that when coating of pharmaceutical substrates is performed before the processing into a solid dosage form a significant improvement in the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical formulations can be obtained. The ALD coating layer coats the individual pharmaceutical particles allowing obtaining dosage forms composed of coated individual particles, without any obligatory need to use excipients such as fillers, binders, disintegrants or lubricants. The properties of such a coated material are considerably better in the further processing of the pharmaceutical formulation into a suitable dosage form.

An advantage to the method of the invention is that difficult, moisture sensitive, electrically charged pharmaceutical substrates can be made more easily processable. The coating generated by the method is thin, dense and smooth; moreover the coating layers deposited by ALD are pinhole-free and very conformal. The pharmaceutical formulations obtained by the methods of the present invention are uniform in the content, which ensures that the same active pharmaceutical ingredient dose is delivered within each dosage form. In addition, the pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention have good protection against moisture, oxygen and light. Furthermore, poor drug solubility may be overcome with an individually tailored coating to allow for modified or sustained release in a specific environment. The consumption of the coating material is low, and thus coating costs may be reduced. In addition, the coated components reduce dosing and administration of associated agents or particles.

The thickness of the coating layer may be controlled by varying the number of molecule layers in the coating. The term thin layer means in this context a layer that may have any thickness between 1 nm and 500 μm, the thickness depends on the pharmaceutical agent, pharmaceutical ingredients and the desired final dosage form.

The coating process of the invention is not sensitive to minor changes in the process parameters, and thus the repeatability of the method is good. Such a uniform layer is not possible to be provided on a three dimensional object for example with CVD method (Chemical Vapor Deposition) or PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) method, since the coating process may not be controlled in such a detail as with the ALD method. CVD and other similar methods also require that the coated object have to be rotated for providing coating material over the whole surface of the three dimensional object.

One of the advantages of present invention is the ability to individually coat particles on both the micro and nano scales. The processing of nanoparticles has been extremely laborious due to electricity, physical interactions and their natural tendency for aggregation.

Another advantage of the present invention is that the process is solvent free, which allows highly soluble as well as highly insoluble drug particles to be easily coated in dry form. The invention overcomes the difficulties of using standard wet chemistry techniques with aqueous solutions wherein highly soluble particles dissolve before they can be coated or the pharmaceutical ingredient or drug substance changes the polymorphic form during processing. Likewise the use of organic and sometimes toxic solvents and plasticizers to apply a coating is not required and hence the chance of incorporation of these undesirable compounds is eliminated.

This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2022-112129 filed on Jul. 13, 2022, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to a radial turbine nozzle and a method for assembling the same.

Description of the Related Art

JP H04-112902 A discloses a gas turbine that comprises a radial turbine, and a radial turbine nozzle (an inlet nozzle) surrounding the radial turbine. The radial turbine nozzle is equipped with an annular shaped nozzle main body. The nozzle main body is equipped with a plurality of blades, a first end wall (a ring plate), and a second end wall (a ring plate). The plurality of blades are arranged at predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction of the radial turbine. The first end wall is connected to one end part of the plurality of blades in an axial direction of the radial turbine. The second end wall is connected to another end part of the plurality of blades in the axial direction.

The nozzle main body includes a plurality of segments (divided pieces). The plurality of segments are connected in a circumferential direction. Each of the plurality of segments includes a first divided annular portion, and a second divided annular portion. The first divided annular portion is formed by dividing the first end wall at a plurality of first divided surfaces that are inclined with respect to a radial direction of the radial turbine. The second divided annular portion is formed by dividing the second end wall at a plurality of second divided surfaces that are inclined with respect to the radial direction.

A back plate that includes a stepped portion is provided in a turbine housing in which the radial turbine is accommodated. The first end wall is arranged on the back plate. The second end wall is arranged in an annular groove that is formed in the turbine housing. The first end wall is pressed toward an outer side in the radial direction by a ring spring, and thereby is placed in contact with the stepped portion of the back plate. Consequently, the radial turbine nozzle is positioned and fixed in place in the radial direction.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In JP H04-112902 A, since the radial turbine nozzle is positioned and fixed in place by the pressing force from the ring spring toward the first end wall, it is difficult to satisfactorily assemble the radial turbine nozzle to the gas turbine. Further, at a time when the gas turbine is placed in use, due to the combustion gas that passes through the radial turbine nozzle, the back plate and the turbine housing which serve as a casing become high in temperature. Consequently, the dimensions of the back plate and the turbine housing undergo a change due to thermal expansion, and a clearance between the plurality of segments becomes large. As a result, a concern arises in that the performance of the gas turbine may deteriorate.

The present invention has the object of solving the aforementioned problem.

12046305	"FIELD

This application relates to non-volatile memory apparatuses and the operation of non-volatile memory apparatuses.

BACKGROUND

This section provides background information related to the technology associated with the present disclosure and, as such, is not necessarily prior art.

Semi-circle drain side select gate (“SC-SGD”) memory technology offers several advantages, including reduced die size. In order to produce SC-SGD, etching technology is used to cut memory holes, thus giving them their semi-circular shape, and separating a block or row into several strings. Depending upon the process used to form the SC-SGD, certain inefficiencies can occur. For example, cutting a memory hole will remove at least some portions of the SC-SGD, such as the metal layer that otherwise shields electrical fields from the channel and/or charge trap layer. For various reasons, the edge word line (e.g., the top data word line) of a memory apparatus having semi-circle drain-side select gates can have a slow erase speed. Such a slow erase speed can cause a shallow erase of the memory cells connected to the edge word line. Accordingly, there is a need for improved non-volatile memory apparatuses and methods of operation.

SUMMARY

This section provides a general summary of the present disclosure and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features and advantages.

An object of the present disclosure is to provide a memory apparatus and a method of operating the memory apparatus that address and overcome the above-noted shortcomings.

The memory cells are disposed in memory holes and configured to retain a threshold voltage corresponding to one of a plurality of data states. A control means is coupled to the plurality of word lines and the memory holes and is configured to determine whether one of the plurality of word lines being programmed in a program operation is a particular one of plurality of word lines adjacent the dummy word line needing a dummy positioning operation. The control means is also configured to program the memory cells connected to the dummy word line to adjust the threshold voltage of the memory cells connected to the dummy word line to a predetermined position threshold voltage in the dummy positioning operation in response to determining the one of the plurality of word lines being programmed in the program operation is the particular one of plurality of word lines adjacent the dummy word line needing the dummy positioning operation.

According to another aspect of the disclosure, a controller in communication with a memory apparatus including memory cells connected to one of a plurality of word lines including a dummy word line and a plurality of other data word lines is also provided. The memory cells are disposed in memory holes and are configured to retain a threshold voltage corresponding to one of a plurality of data states. The controller is configured to determine whether one of the plurality of word lines being programmed in a program operation is a particular one of plurality of word lines adjacent the dummy word line needing a dummy positioning operation. The controller is also configured to instruct the memory apparatus to program the memory cells connected to the dummy word line to adjust the threshold voltage of the memory cells connected to the dummy word line to a predetermined position threshold voltage in the dummy positioning operation in response to determining the one of the plurality of word lines being programmed in the program operation is the particular one of plurality of word lines adjacent the dummy word line needing the dummy positioning operation.

According to an additional aspect of the disclosure, a method of operating a memory apparatus is provided. The memory apparatus includes memory cells connected to one of a plurality of word lines including a dummy word line and a plurality of other data word lines is also provided. The memory cells are disposed in memory holes and are configured to retain a threshold voltage corresponding to one of a plurality of data states. The method includes the step of determining whether one of the plurality of word lines being programmed in a program operation is a particular one of plurality of word lines adjacent the dummy word line needing a dummy positioning operation. The method continues with the step of programming the memory cells connected to the dummy word line to adjust the threshold voltage of the memory cells connected to the dummy word line to a predetermined position threshold voltage in the dummy positioning operation in response to determining the one of the plurality of word lines being programmed in the program operation is the particular one of plurality of word lines adjacent the dummy word line needing the dummy positioning operation.

11970323	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a package, in particular for containing products, for example of a food type. The invention also relates to a process and a relative apparatus for manufacturing this package using a support or tray designed to house at least one product, and a plastic film mating with the support or tray in order to seal the product into the package. The invention may have application in vacuum packaging or in controlled atmosphere packaging of products of various type.

PRIOR ART

In the food packaging field, packages closed by means of plastic films and provided with a facilitated opening system are known: the facilitated opening system aims to ensure a simple opening and rapid extraction of the product from the package by a user.

A first example of a facilitated opening package, described in the French patent application FR 3002209 A1, provides a tray having a substantially rectangular shape and a plastic film welded to a peripheral edge of the tray. The tray and the film comprise respective gripping portions. A first part of the film gripping portion can be lifted relative to the underlying tray gripping portion, while a second part of the film gripping portion is attached to a stiffening tab separable from the tray: the second part of the film gripping portion together with the stiffening tab form an opening portion which can be grasped by the user for opening the package, while the gripping portion of the tray, on the other hand, is the part which can be grasped by the user for holding the support while removing the film from the package. Applicant has noted that the opening system of French patent application FR 3002209 A1 presents a number of drawbacks: in particular, this system requires a relatively big amount of material for making the package and substantial changes to conventional tray forming and packaging processes to provide, at the same time, sealing of the package, adhesion between the second part of the film gripping portion and the stiffening tab of the tray, and separation between the first part of the film gripping portion and the gripping portion of the tray. In other words, the complex design of the opening system negatively impacts in terms of production costs, complexity of the manufacturing process and overall size of the package. Document WO2019123382 is directed to a package comprising a support having a base configured for receiving one or more products, a peripheral edge surrounding the base, and a removable portion extending as a prolongation of the peripheral edge away from the base. The package further comprises a closing film engaged with a portion of the peripheral edge and with the removable portion for defining a housing compartment for the product, and a gripping portion emerging from the peripheral edge: the removable portion is configured for being separated from the support, together with the film, during opening of the package. When the package is in a closed condition, the closing film is joined to the support to prevent access to the housing compartment and the removable portion is aligned with the peripheral edge from which it extends as a prolongation. The removable portion also has a cavity which presents a concavity, at least in the closed condition of the package, facing the peripheral edge. The gripping portion is disposed, at least in the closed condition of the package, within this cavity. Although this solution represents a significant improvement over the above French reference, the Applicant found further ways to simplify the overall package thereby offering an easy to manufacture package provided with facilitated opening properties.

OBJECT OF THE INVENTION

The object of the present invention is to solve the drawbacks and/or limitations of the above prior art.

A first object of the invention is to provide a package having an effective facilitated opening system to allow the user a simple and quick opening of the package; in particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a package that provides the user with a rapid tactile or visual perception of the facilitated opening system.

A further object of the present invention is to provide a package having a simple and cost-effective structure which at the same time can ensure a convenient and stable handling of the package during the opening of the latter.

A further object is to provide a package that can be manufactured by means of a simple and fast in-line production, which does not require expensive modifications to the manufacturing plants of standard packages, i.e. those used for making packages without a facilitated opening system.

A further object is to provide a package designed to speed up manufacturing operations and to reduce manufacturing costs.

These and yet other objects, which will become more apparent from the following description, are substantially achieved by a package, an apparatus and a related process for manufacturing the package according to one or more of the accompanying claims and/or the following aspects.

The present application claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 202210038374.7, filed Jan. 13, 2022, and entitled “Dynamic Snapshot Scheduling Using Storage System Metrics,” which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

FIELD

The field relates generally to information processing techniques and more particularly, to techniques for protecting information.

BACKGROUND

Snapshots are utilized by information processing systems to save a state of a storage system at a given point in time. A user typically specifies a snapshot schedule that determines when a snapshot of one or more target logical volumes is created, using a technique that is sometimes referred to as snapshot scheduling. When snapshot scheduling is used, however, a new snapshot is typically created strictly according to the schedule. Such a snapshot may result in inadequate data protection, reduced storage system performance and/or a waste of storage system resources.

A need exists for improved techniques for scheduling snapshots.

SUMMARY

In one embodiment, a method comprises obtaining a schedule for generating snapshots of at least a portion of a storage system; automatically adjusting one or more snapshot generation parameters in the schedule based at least in part on at least one of: (i) a current storage pool usage metric, (ii) an input/output metric of at least one storage resource in the portion of the storage system, (iii) a measure of snapshots in a destroying state, and (iv) a measure of a number of created snapshots; and initiating a generation of a snapshot of the at least the portion of the storage system in accordance with the adjusted schedule.

In some embodiments, the one or more snapshot generation parameters comprise a snapshot generation frequency that is maintained within a range specified by a user. The adjusting may comprise increasing the snapshot generation frequency in response to an increase of one or more of: the current storage pool usage metric, the measure of snapshots in the destroying state, and the measure of the number of created snapshots. The adjusting may also comprise decreasing the snapshot generation frequency in response to an increase of the input/output metric of the at least one storage resource in the portion of the storage system.

Other illustrative embodiments include, without limitation, apparatus, systems, methods and computer program products comprising processor-readable storage media.

12089331	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a metal circuit structure, and more particularly to a metal circuit structure based on FPC and a method of making the same.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A flexible printed circuit (FPC) is made of polyimide or polyester film to have a high reliability and flexibility, and the FPC has high wiring density, compact weight, and thin thickness.

Chip On Flex (COF) or Chip On Film (COF) is applied to fix a drive integrated circuit (IC) on a chip of a flexible circuit board, wherein a substrate is flexible and is configured to carry and adhere the chips with the flexible circuit board, and the COF is capable of obtaining high accuracy of FPC. However, a thickness of tin of COP is thick. The COF has many tiny circuits attached on a film so as to avoid a removal. In addition, the circuits are hot pressed with pins of a chip, so it is necessary to have immersion tin on the circuits. To maintain a thickness of tin on the circuits after a baking process, the thickness of the tin is increased after having immersion tin on the circuits, but a height of the circuits increase to cause a removal of the film from the circuits. Furthermore, the thickness of the tin cannot be controlled exactly, thus increasing defective rate and fabrication cost.

The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages.

The present invention relates generally to disposable absorbent articles, such as baby diapers, training pants, adult incontinence products, feminine hygiene articles, and the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to improved absorbent core components, disposable absorbent articles utilizing such absorbent core components, and a method of making or manufacturing same.

An advantageous application of the various concepts and embodiments of the present invention is one directed to baby diapers. For this reason, much of the exemplary descriptions provided herein are directed to diapers. The invention extends, of course, to applications beyond diapers.

Most absorbent articles used today as baby diapers have a configuration similar to the absorbent article10depicted inFIGS.1A and1B. The conventional absorbent article10is shown in a laid out flat position inFIG.1A, and in cross sectional view inFIG.1B. This absorbent article10includes an outer-side fluid impermeable backsheet101, a bodyside, fluid permeable nonwoven coverstock or topsheet102, and an absorbent construction110positioned between the backsheet101and topsheet102. An absorbent core103provides the primary component of the absorbent construction110and is designed and positioned to receive and retain bodily fluids. The absorbent construction110may also include at least one fluid management, fluid distribution and/or surge layer104.

As shown inFIG.1A, the backsheet101and topsheet102together form or define a chassis or central body105of the absorbent article10. The central body105may be described as having a first longitudinal end edge112a, a second longitudinal end edge112b, and a longitudinal centerline YY that extends through the central body111, bisecting both the first and second end edges112a,112b. Left and side margins106a,106bextend from one end edge112ato the other end edge112b. Each end edge112a,112bpartly defines waist regions113a,113bof the central body105which are generally characterized as having a lateral width significantly greater than a lateral width of a central region or crotch region114of the central body105. The waist regions113a,113bare designed to allow the absorbent article10to be placed about the waist of the user. In this respect, the first and second waist regions113a,113bmay be described as front and rear waist regions113a,113b, respectively. The conventional absorbent article10further includes a fastening means104attached to each side of the rear waist region113a. The fastening means104are extendible and thereby, fastenable to a corresponding side of the front waist region113b. The fastening means104helps to retain the article10around and on the body of the user. The absorbent article10also includes a means for elasticizing107the article10to maintain closure and sealing around the user's legs. The elasticizing means1057(e.g., leg cuffs and/or leg cutters) are necessarily positioned outboard of and along longitudinal side margins106of the absorbent construction110. Referring toFIG.1A, the conventional absorbent core110is centrally positioned in and about the crotch region114of the absorbent article10.

Currently, most diaper cores are made from mixtures of fibers and superabsorbent particles, specifically cellulose based fibers derived from wood pulp and superabsorbent particles (SAP) derived from polyacrylic acid derivatives. An absorbent composite that is particularly suited for application in or with the disposable absorbent articles introduced herein is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,540,853. SAP-nonwoven absorbent composites of the type disclosed in this patent reference are available to the diaper manufacturing process in roll form and allow much greater freedom for the design of absorbent cores. Nevertheless, because fluff pulp-superabsorbent cores are generally provided as a continuous stream or web of absorbent material, the simpler and most cost efficient processes require the absorbent core to be maintained in a generally rectangular shape.

These cores are typically formed into rectangular shapes that are designed for incorporation into an absorbent article. The core shape, particularly its width, is maintained at dimensions that accommodate placement within a diaper corresponding with the crotch area of the user. Moreover, it is preferred in many applications for the absorbent core to take on a nearly hourglass shape. Such diaper cores are known in the art as providing a narrower crotch region that presents a better fit and comfort for the user. The hourglass shape also provides wider regions at the longitudinal ends of the core, which enhances the absorbency and leakage control capability of the diaper at those regions above the central crotch region.

FIG.1Cillustrates another prior art disposable absorbent article10′. The absorbent article10′ employs a design in which an absorbent core110′ is reduced in width in the crotch region114′, but is wider at the front and rear waist regions113a′,113b′. The result is an absorbent core110′ having a more hourglass shape. To achieve this desired hourglass shaped core, a rectangular absorbent core section is cut from a continuous web of absorbent material and shaped further, particularly in forming the narrow central region.

As known in the art, the preferred diaper assembly process is a substantially linear and efficient machine directed process that produces a high volume of packaged products. Because of the nature of the consumer product as a disposable, high frequency of use item and the abundance of competing products and alternative products (e.g., re-usable cloth diapers), it is imperative to maintain the low cost of the final product. Accordingly, it is also imperative to control the complexity of the manufacturing process and to minimize steps and material waste. This presents a technical challenge to one attempting to create alternative shapes and functionalities in the conventional disposable absorbent article. For example, although an hourglass shaped diaper core is generally desirable or, in some applications, a core having distinct areas of absorbency, additional cutting or forming steps or increased material cost may make the alternative design less effective.

In any event, absorbent core configurations achieving further functionalities and/or improved fit and comfort for the sure are desirable. Caution must be exercised, however, to minimize material cost and manufacturing complexity.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is particularly directed to achieving absorbent core configurations that easily accommodate the conventional disposable absorbent article and maintains comfort and fit for the user. Such absorbent core configurations, and disposable absorbent articles employing same, are readily made at high volume without overburdening the manufacturing process with additional steps and material waste. In this respect, the invention provides improved hourglass or nearly hourglass shaped core constructions by providing and presenting more usable and flexible core components or core elements and incorporating these components into highly effective diapers, training pants and the like.

In one aspect, a disposable absorbent article is provided having a central body defining a first waist end region including a first longitudinal end edge, a second waist end region spaced longitudinally from the first waist end region and including a second longitudinal end edge, and a crotch region positioned therebetween. An absorbent core is situated between the end edges, and includes a first core element formed by materials imparting absorbent properties and a second core element formed by materials imparting absorbent properties. The second core element partially superimposes the first core element to form a multi-layer primary absorbent region of the absorbent core.

In another aspect, a disposable absorbent article is provided having a central body defining a first waist end region including a first end edge, a second waist end region spaced longitudinally from the first waist end region and including a second end edge, and a crotch region positioned therebetween. The absorbent core is situated between the end edges, and includes a plurality of elastics incorporated therewith such that the core is substantially laterally contracted in a narrowed region about the elastics. The absorbent core includes at least one end region that is substantially non-elasticized, and the at least one end region has a lateral width substantially wider than a lateral width of the narrowed region.

These exemplary aspects and other aspects of the invention are illustrated throughFIGS.1-14and/or the Detailed Description provided below.

This disclosure relates to the technical field of encryption and decryption of data. More specifically, this disclosure relates to systems and methods for performing secure analytics using a homomorphic encryption including analytics for machine learning models.

Advantageously, a homomorphic encrypted analytic can execute on a server in an unsecure environment and there by obfuscate information about the analytic that could be derived by examination of the analytic. This information could include the information about computation being performed, intellectual property, proprietary information, sensitive information, or protected classes of information. Specifically, the analytics include trained machine learning models, sent in a homomorphic encrypted scheme, and executed in an unsecure environment. Thereby, the encrypted analytic can be sent to an untrusted environment, be evaluated against data under the untrusted party's control, and generate an encrypted prediction, classification or other result which can be transmitted back to a trusted environment. The decrypted result will be the same as if the unencrypted machine analytic operated on the data.

BACKGROUND

With development of computer technologies, many sensitive data, such as financial information and medical records can be kept on remote servers or cloud-based computing resources. Authorized users can access the sensitive data using applications running, for example, on their personal computing devices. Typically, personal computing devices are connected, via data networks, to servers or cloud-based computing resources. Therefore, the sensitive data can be subject to unauthorized access.

Encryption techniques, such as a homomorphic encryption, can be applied to the sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access. The encryption techniques can be used to protect “data in use”, “data in rest”, and “data in transit”. A homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption in which a specific algebraic operation (generally referred to as addition or multiplication) performed on plaintext, is equivalent to another operation performed on ciphertext. For example, in Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) schemes, multiplication in ciphertext is equal to addition of the same values in plaintext.

The present disclosure pertains to mobile communications, and more particularly pertains to extending primary communication devices with a detachable, self-contained housing for providing automatic failover from a primary network to a meshed communications network.

BACKGROUND

In an increasingly digital and interconnected age, reliable communications have become a cornerstone upon which many aspects of modern life are built. Although typically considered in the context of everyday usage scenarios, such as at the office or the home, reliable communications are also of tremendous importance in governmental and military contexts, in which failed or unreliable communications are not just a mere inconvenience but can put multiple lives at risk. Somewhat closer to home, reliable communications have proven to be essential in providing emergency services and emergency response—yet to this day, large numbers of natural disasters, humanitarian crises, and other emergency events continue to suffer from a lack of reliable communications. Regardless of the context, in the absence of the ability to communicate and send data, the flow of information grinds to a halt, crippling decision-making and logistical operations during times of crisis or need.

In the context of communications systems that are designed for military or emergency use, or are otherwise designed to be robust against failure, a primary focus is communication availability and reliability at the network edge. Another important design factor is communications redundancy. For example, military personnel operate various forms of different communications equipment in an attempt to ensure that audio and/or data connectivity are maintained in the event of a communications failure at the tactical edge. In light of these two factors (network robustness/edge reliability and communications redundancy), communication systems can be designed to accommodate changing conditions in a network deployment environment by carrying hardware for communication over multiple different networks.

However, conventional systems are cumbersome, bulky, and provide secondary network radios that are low power/low range, low bandwidth, and generally inappropriate for mission critical use cases. Moreover, conventional systems do not seamlessly integrate with a user's existing primary communication device in a convenient form factor, instead requiring users to carry two separate devices while also ensuring that a connection between the devices is not broken or interrupted. Accordingly, it would be desirable to not only provide a more powerful, efficient and secure failover network that can be integrated with user communication devices operating on a primary communication network, but also to integrate the secure failover network into a convenient and compact form factor that can be seamless combined with a user's existing communication device(s).

SUMMARY

Disclosed herein are systems and methods for providing various communication devices with automatic failover from a primary communication network to a meshed communication network, wherein the meshed communication network is provided by a self-contained mesh radio unit detachably coupled to the primary communication device.

The self-contained mesh radio unit can be both communicatively coupled to the primary communication device and/or physically coupled to the primary communication device. In some embodiments, the primary communication device comprises a smartphone and the self-contained mesh radio unit is integrated into a case or housing that receives the smartphone (see, e.g.,FIGS.3A and3B). In this fashion, the smartphone can be both communicatively coupled (e.g., via its female USB-C or other data port/connector) and physically coupled (e.g., via its own housing) to the self-contained mesh radio unit in an approximately simultaneous fashion, simply by inserting the smartphone into the case portion of the self-contained mesh radio unit's housing.

In other words, aspects of the present disclosure contemplate a housing that not only contains all of the constituent components of the self-contained mesh radio unit but can further be employed as a case or sleeve for receiving the smartphone and communicatively coupling it to the self-contained mesh radio unit. Notably, this provides a seamless and improved user experience in comparison to conventional solutions, which at most permit an external radio (in an entirely separate housing) to be connected to a communication device, therefore requiring a user to carry and keep track of two separate physical devices that furthermore are prone to becoming disconnected when jostled, bumped or subject to other movements.

Moreover, unlike conventional solutions that are limited to low power, low range, low bandwidth radios, the presently disclosed self-contained mesh radio unit is suitable for use in mission critical applications, providing high bandwidth secure/encrypted communications from short range up to intermediate or long ranges. Where conventional solutions provide bandwidth in the kilobits/s range, the presently disclosed self-contained mesh radio unit can achieve bandwidths that are multiple orders of magnitude greater, providing bandwidth in excess of several hundred megabits/s depending on environmental factors. Furthermore, in addition to augmenting communication reliability when moving in and out of cell coverage (whether provided by public carriers or private infrastructure), the presently disclosed self-contained mesh radio system is also fully capable of operating in austere communication environments where no cellular or primary communication network coverage exists. As will be described in greater depth below, the presently disclosed self-contained mesh radio system and units are able to mesh smartphone and user communication devices directly to one another in a dynamic, self-healing, closed L2 (layer 2) network when disconnected from a serving carrier or primary communication network.

The self-contained mesh radio unit and its associated meshed communication network augment the functionality of the primary communication network (e.g., LTE, 5G, etc.) relied upon by the communication device—where these primary communication networks depend heavily on both the availability and proximity of the communication device to centralized base stations, the meshed communication network does not: in the absence of primary network availability, the self-contained mesh radio unit and can perform automatic failover to the meshed communication network and thereby provide direct, peer-to-peer communications to other users and/or communication devices reachable through the meshed communication network.

For example, in some embodiments it is contemplated that the meshed communication network is formed wholly or partly of users having smartphones with the presently disclosed self-contained mesh radio unit coupled thereto. However, it is also contemplated that the self-contained mesh radio unit can operate independently of smartphones and other primary communication devices—rather than performing failover from a primary LTE or other communication network, the self-contained mesh radio unit can instead provide dedicated access to the meshed communication network to one or more laptops and other IP connectivity devices. This dedicated access for additional devices can be performed when the self-contained mesh radio unit is already coupled with a communication device (e.g., with a smartphone already installed in the receiving case portion of the mesh radio unit's housing) and/or can be performed in standalone fashion (without a smartphone or other communication device physically coupled to the housing of the mesh radio unit).

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

The object of the invention is to provide a power supply without batteries or high capacity capacitors to operate a mechatronic system, such that the energy generated by the electric generator of the mechatronic system is instantly and simultaneously consumed by the elements that require energy to operate, such as microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, etc.

The invention uses the increasing electrical energy produced by a mechatronic electric generator to cascade the components of the mechatronic system, starting with the control portion (microcontrollers) since this portion has the lowest operating voltage and power, and continuing with the rest of the components of the mechatronic system such as sensors and actuators that have a higher activation voltage and power than that of the microcontroller.

Description of Related Art

The present invention belongs to the mechatronics sector, and more specifically to the power supply of embedded systems with low power consumption wherein electrical energy comes from an electric generator that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

Technical Problem to be Solved and Background of the Invention

Currently, there are many ways to electrically power embedded systems. The most common systems are wired systems and those that operate with rechargeable or changeable batteries, and even systems that are used with rechargeable batteries through the technology known as “Energy Harvesting”. In recent times, however, embedded systems without batteries have become very mainstream due to the problems of environmental sustainability that batteries entail.

To replace batteries, supercapacitors are used with different ways of generating energy; there are generators that generate continuous energy for a long time (solar panels, temperature or vibration energy harvesters, etc.), but there are other types of generators that generate considerable energy in a short period of time (dynamos, piezoelectric materials, etc.).

The problem with using a supercapacitor is that, unlike a battery, the voltage across the supercapacitor depends on the amount of energy stored. In other words, the voltage decreases virtually linearly as the supercapacitor delivers the charge it has stored, whereas the battery is capable of delivering the charge and maintaining the voltage at an almost constant level until the battery is completely discharged, at which point the voltage across the battery terminals decreases exponentially.

The main problem with generating electrical energy from scratch in a short period of time, and using it in that same time, or a few seconds later, is that if said energy is stored in a supercapacitor or a capacitor, for its later use, there is a high percentage of electrical energy that cannot be used, since its voltage does not reach the minimum voltage required for the correct operation of the embedded system.

As an example,FIG.1shows that for a 5.5V supercapacitor and an embedded mechatronic system in a lock that operates with a minimum voltage of 3.3V, around 20% of the energy generated by the electric generator will be useless. The higher the capacity of the capacitor, the more energy will be required to reach the voltage needed to use the mechatronic system.

As an example, the results of a recharge test of 5.5V supercapacitors with different capacities are shown; they have been charged at a 100 mA current and the recharge time of each one has been calculated. If we assume that the operating voltages of the embedded system range from 3.3V to 5.5V, all the energy charged up to 3.3V is energy that cannot be used. The result obtained is the following:

5.5V and 0.1 F:

From 0 to 5.5V: Average voltage=3.797658 V; Total time=3.213788 s; Power=0.339 mWhFrom 0 to 3.3V: Average voltage=2.491079V; Total time=1.019281 s; Power=0.071 mWh21% of the energy generated cannot be used
5.5V and 0.22 F:From 0 to 5.5V: Average voltage=3.695646 V; Total time=4.945991 s; Power=0.508 mWhFrom 0 to 3.3V: Average voltage=2.474711 V; Total time=1.730389 s; Power=0.119 mWh23% of the energy generated cannot be used
5.5V and 1 F:From 0 to 5.5V: Average voltage=3.944717 V; Total time=26.610774 s; Power=2.916 mWhFrom 0 to 3.3V: Average voltage=2.673263 V; Total time=7.893806 s; Power=0.586 mWh20% of the energy generated cannot be used

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention discloses several aspects related to mechatronic systems, including a method of activating them.

In the present description, and given that it relates to electrical components, the term “connected” means that two elements that are “connected” can be directly connected and/or connected through other elements. Likewise, the term “connected” can refer to an electrical connection (power supply) and/or a data connection.

In a first aspect of the invention, a cascade activation mechatronic system is disclosed which comprises an electric generator that generates variable voltage electrical energy from a minimum voltage to a maximum voltage, from mechanical energy. The electrical energy generated by the electric generator is of variable voltage over time and can have different shapes (bell, peak, etc.), such that the shape of variable voltage electrical energy begins at a minimum voltage and reaches a maximum voltage where it is maintained for a short time (peak shape) or a long time (bell shape) and then falls back down to the minimum voltage value. The cascade activation mechatronic system of the present invention further comprises:a first voltage regulator connected to an output of the electric generator, for powering the first voltage regulator, wherein the first voltage regulator generates at least one first activation voltage greater than the minimum voltage of the electric generator;a microcontroller connected to an output of the first voltage regulator for powering the microcontroller, wherein the microcontroller has a power supply voltage equivalent to the first activation voltage;a voltage converter connected to an output of the electric generator and grounding for powering the voltage converter, wherein the voltage converter is configured to generate and send an activation signal to the microcontroller for any voltage value, greater than or equal to the minimum voltage of the electric generator; the activation signal indicates to the microcontroller that the electric generator is generating energy;an actuator connected to the output of the electric generator, for powering the actuator with unregulated voltage, wherein the actuator has an activation voltage greater than the first activation voltage of the first voltage regulator, and wherein the actuator is configured to simultaneously consume a portion of the electrical energy generated by the electric generator.

In other words, the microcontroller is the element with the lowest power supply/activation voltage of all the elements comprised in the mechatronic system except for the voltage converter. The voltage converter is in charge of communicating to the microcontroller that there is voltage in the electric generator. In this way, the microcontroller is the first element in the system that is activated to be able to control the operation of the rest of the elements comprised in the mechatronic system. The microcontroller uses data lines to communicate with the rest of the elements in the system. In one embodiment of the invention, the microcontroller comprises an activation line that can be connected to the actuator for the actuator to be activated/deactivated by the microcontroller. For any embodiment of the invention, the microcontroller has a non-volatile memory to store data.

In the present description, a “voltage regulator with an activation voltage” is an electronic device that, for any voltage value it receives at its input, the voltage regulator has at its output a constant voltage value that corresponds to the “activation voltage”. In this way, and applying the foregoing to the “microcontroller” and the “first voltage regulator”, the “first voltage regulator” generates at its output a constant voltage whose value is the “first activation voltage” which is the voltage that the microcontroller requires to be activated/powered, provided that the power at the input of the voltage regulator is greater than or equal to the power at the output of the voltage regulator.

In one embodiment of the invention, the cascade activation mechatronic system may comprise a second voltage regulator with a second activation voltage greater than the first activation voltage, and wherein the second voltage regulator has an input connected to the output of the electric generator.

In one embodiment of the invention, the cascade activation mechatronic system may comprise a third voltage regulator with a third activation voltage greater than the second activation voltage, and wherein the third voltage regulator has an input connected to the output of the electric generator.

In one embodiment of the invention, the cascade activation mechatronic system may comprise a fourth and successive voltage regulators if each voltage regulator has an activation voltage greater than the previous one.

In one embodiment of the invention, the cascade activation mechatronic system may comprise a multi-level voltage regulator comprising the first voltage regulator, the second voltage regulator, the third voltage regulator, and the fourth and successive voltage regulators of previous embodiments. The multi-level voltage regulator has an input connected to the electric generator and different outputs, that is, at least as many outputs as internal voltage regulators that the multi-level voltage regulator has.

In another embodiment of the invention, the cascade activation mechatronic system may comprise a non-return diode connected to an output of the electric generator. The non-return diode prevents energy from returning to the electric generator and being lost.

In another embodiment of the invention, the cascade activation mechatronic system may also comprise a capacitor connected to the output of the non-return diode and grounding, wherein the capacitor is configured to eliminate the noise of the variable voltage electrical energy from the electric generator, absorb switching peaks or sensor/actuator start-up and store the variable voltage electrical energy not consumed by the rest of the elements of the circuit (voltage regulators, microcontroller, voltage converter, sensor, actuator).

In another embodiment of the invention, the third voltage regulator is interconnected between the actuator and the electric generator. In this way, the actuator receives from the third voltage regulator a power supply with regulated voltage provided by the third voltage regulator.

In another embodiment of the invention, the cascade activation mechatronic system of the present invention comprises a sensor connected to the second voltage regulator. The sensor has a power supply voltage equal to the second activation voltage of the second voltage regulator. The sensor is configured to simultaneously consume a portion of the electrical energy generated by the electric generator.

In another embodiment of the invention, the microcontroller is further configured to activate the sensor and the actuator, sequentially at predefined time intervals. The predefined time intervals require prior knowledge of the way in which energy is generated by the electric generator. Specifically, the time elapsed is calculated from when energy starts to be generated by the electric generator (beginning of the curve) until when the voltage/power is sufficient to activate the components of the system such as the microcontroller, the voltage regulators, the sensor(s), and the actuator(s).

In another embodiment of the invention, the cascade activation mechatronic system may comprise a voltage meter connected between the output of the electric generator and grounding. The voltage meter is configured to measure the variable voltage of the electrical energy generated by the electric generator and to send the measured voltage to the microcontroller. If a sensor is connected to the second voltage meter, the microcontroller sends an activation signal to the sensor when the measured voltage is equal to the second activation voltage. If an actuator is connected to the third voltage meter, the microcontroller sends an activation signal to the actuator when the measured voltage is equal to the third activation voltage. If an actuator is connected to the output of the electric generator, the microcontroller sends an activation signal to the actuator when the measured voltage is equal to the activation/power supply voltage of the actuator.

In another embodiment of the invention, the actuator is a motor. The motor may be connected to the output of the electric generator for a non-regulated power supply, i.e., non-constant voltage, to the motor. Alternatively, the motor may be connected to the output of a voltage regulator for a constant voltage power supply to the motor, depending on the needs of the motor.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

Disclosed herein are novel tomato plant cells, tomato plants and tomato seeds derived from such plant cells and having enhanced traits, and methods of making and using such plant cells and derived plants and seeds.

BACKGROUND

Plant breeding and engineering currently relies on Mendelian genetics or recombinant techniques.

SUMMARY

Disclosed herein are methods for providing novel tomato plant cells or tomato plant protoplasts, plant callus, tissues or parts, whole tomato plants, and tomato seeds having one or more altered genetic sequences. Among other features, the methods and compositions described herein enable the stacking of preferred alleles without introducing unwanted genetic or epigenetic variation in the modified plants or plant cells. The efficiency and reliability of these targeted modification methods are significantly improved relative to traditional plant breeding, and can be used not only to augment traditional breeding techniques but also as a substitute for them.

In one aspect, the invention provides a method of changing expression of a sequence of interest in a genome, including integrating a sequence encoded by a polynucleotide, such as a double-stranded or single-stranded polynucleotides including DNA, RNA, or a combination of DNA and RNA, at the site of at least one double-strand break (DSB) in a genome, which can be the genome of a eukaryotic nucleus (e. g., the nuclear genome of a plant cell) or a genome of an organelle (e. g., a mitochondrion or a plastid in a plant cell). Effector molecules for site-specific introduction of a DSB into a genome include various endonucleases (e. g., RNA-guided nucleases such as a type II Cas nuclease, a Cas9, a type V Cas nuclease, a Cpf1, a CasY, a CasX, a C2c1, or a C2c3) and guide RNAs that direct cleavage by an RNA-guided nuclease. Embodiments include those where the DSB is introduced into a genome by a ribonucleoprotein complex containing both a site-specific nuclease (e. g., Cas9, Cpf1, CasX, CasY, C2c1, C2c3) and at least one guide RNA, or by a site-specific nuclease in combination with at least one guide RNA; in some of these embodiments no plasmid or other expression vector is utilized to provide the nuclease, the guide RNA, or the polynucleotide. These effector molecules are delivered to the cell or organelle wherein the DSB is to be introduced by the use of one or more suitable composition or treatment, such as at least one chemical, enzymatic, or physical agent, or application of heat or cold, ultrasonication, centrifugation, electroporation, particle bombardment, and bacterially mediated transformation. It is generally desirable that the DSB is induced at high efficiency. One measure of efficiency is the percentage or fraction of the population of cells that have been treated with a DSB-inducing agent and in which the DSB is successfully introduced at the correct site in the genome. The efficiency of genome editing is assessed by any suitable method such as a heteroduplex cleavage assay or by sequencing, as described elsewhere in this disclosure. In various embodiments, the DSB is introduced at a comparatively high efficiency, e. g., at about 20, about 30, about 40, about 50, about 60, about 70, or about 80 percent efficiency, or at greater than 80, 85, 90, or 95 percent efficiency. In embodiments, the DSB is introduced upstream of, downstream of, or within the sequence of interest, which is coding, non-coding, or a combination of coding and non-coding sequence. In embodiments, a sequence encoded by the polynucleotide (such as a double-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid, or a double-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid), when integrated into the site of the DSB in the genome, is then functionally or operably linked to the sequence of interest, e. g., linked in a manner that modifies the transcription or the translation of the sequence of interest or that modifies the stability of a transcript including that of the sequence of interest. Embodiments include those where two or more DSBs are introduced into a genome, and wherein a sequence encoded by a polynucleotide (such as a double-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid, or a double-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid) that is integrated into each DSB is the same or different for each of the DSBs. In embodiments, at least two DSBs are introduced into a genome by one or more nucleases in such a way that genomic sequence (coding, non-coding, or a combination of coding and non-coding sequence) is deleted between the DSBs (leaving a deletion with blunt ends, overhangs or a combination of a blunt end and an overhang), and a sequence encoded by a polynucleotide (such as a double-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid, or a double-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid) molecule is integrated between the DSBs (i. e., at the location of the deleted genomic sequence). The method is particularly useful for integrating into the site of a DSB a heterologous nucleotide sequence that provides a useful function or use. For example, the method is useful for integrating or introducing into the genome a heterologous sequence that stops or knocks out expression of a sequence of interest (such as a gene encoding a protein), or a heterologous sequence that is a unique identifier nucleotide sequence, or a heterologous sequence that is (or that encodes) a sequence recognizable by a specific binding agent or that binds to a specific molecule, or a heterologous sequence that stabilizes or destabilizes a transcript containing it. Embodiments include use of the method to integrate or introduce into a genome sequence of a promoter or promoter-like element (e. g., sequence of an auxin-binding or hormone-binding or transcription-factor-binding element, or sequence of or encoding an aptamer or riboswitch), or a sequence-specific binding or cleavage site sequence (e. g., sequence of or encoding an endonuclease cleavage site, a small RNA recognition site, a recombinase site, a splice site, or a transposon recognition site). In embodiments, the method is used to delete or otherwise modify to make non-functional an endogenous functional sequence, such as a hormone- or transcription-factor-binding element, or a small RNA or recombinase or transposon recognition site. In embodiments, additional molecules are used to effect a desired expression result or a desired genomic change. For example, the method is used to integrate heterologous recombinase recognition site sequences at two DSBs in a genome, and the appropriate recombinase molecule is employed to excise genomic sequence located between the recombinase recognition sites. In another example, the method is used to integrate a polynucleotide-encoded heterologous small RNA recognition site sequence at a DSB in a sequence of interest in a genome, wherein when the small RNA is present (e. g., expressed endogenously or transiently or transgenically), the small RNA binds to and cleaves the transcript of the sequence of interest that contains the integrated small RNA recognition site. In another example, the method is used to integrate in the genome of a tomato plant or plant cell a polynucleotide-encoded promoter or promoter-like element that is responsive to a specific molecule (e. g., an auxin, a hormone, a drug, an herbicide, or a polypeptide), wherein a specific level of expression of the sequence of interest is obtained by providing the corresponding specific molecule to the plant or plant cell; in a non-limiting example, an auxin-binding element is integrated into the promoter region of a protein-coding sequence in the genome of a plant or plant cell, whereby the expression of the protein is upregulated when the corresponding auxin is exogenously provided to the plant or plant cell (e. g., by adding the auxin to the medium of the plant cell or by spraying the auxin onto the plant). Another aspect of the invention is a tomato cell including in its genome a heterologous DNA sequence, wherein the heterologous sequence includes (a) nucleotide sequence of a polynucleotide integrated by the method at the site of a DSB in the genome, and (b) genomic nucleotide sequence adjacent to the site of the DSB; related aspects include a plant containing such a cell including in its genome a heterologous DNA sequence, progeny seed or plants (including hybrid progeny seed or plants) of the plant, and processed or commodity products derived from the plant or from progeny seed or plants. In another aspect, the invention provides a heterologous nucleotide sequence including (a) nucleotide sequence of a polynucleotide (such as a double-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid, or a double-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid) molecule integrated by the method at the site of a DSB in a genome, and (b) genomic nucleotide sequence adjacent to the site of the DSB; related aspects include larger polynucleotides such as a plasmid, vector, or chromosome including the heterologous nucleotide sequence, as well as a polymerase primer for amplification of the heterologous nucleotide sequence.

In another aspect, the invention provides a composition including a plant cell and a polynucleotide (such as a double-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA, a single-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid, or a double-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid) donor molecule that is capable of being integrated at (or having its sequence integrated at) a double-strand break in genomic sequence in the plant cell. In various embodiments, the plant cell is an isolated plant cell or plant protoplast, or is in a monocot plant or dicot plant, a zygotic or somatic embryo, seed, plant part, or plant tissue.

Specific embodiments include compositions including a plant cell, at least one dsDNA molecule, and at least one ribonucleoprotein complex containing both a site-specific nuclease (e. g., Cas9, Cpf1, CasX, CasY, C2c1, C2c3) and at least one guide RNA; in some of these embodiments, the composition contains no plasmid or other expression vector for providing the nuclease, the guide RNA, or the dsDNA. In embodiments of the composition, the polynucleotide donor molecule is double-stranded DNA or RNA or a combination of DNA and RNA, and is blunt-ended, or contains one or more terminal overhangs, or contains chemical modifications such as phosphorothioate bonds or a detectable label.

In some embodiments, expression is increased between 10-100%; between 2-fold and 5-fold; between 2 and 10-fold; between 10-fold and 50-fold; between 10-fold and a 100-fold; between 100-fold and 1000-fold; between 1000-fold and 5,000-fold; between 5,000-fold and 10,000 fold. In some embodiments, a targeted insertion may decrease expression by at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more.

In yet another embodiment of the targeted insertion methods described above, the donor polynucleotide is tethered to a crRNA by a covalent bond, a non-covalent bond, or a combination of covalent and non-covalent bonds. In a related embodiment, the invention provides a composition for targeting a genome comprising a donor polynucleotide tethered to a cRNA by a covalent bond, a non-covalent bond, or a combination of covalent and non-covalent bonds.

In another embodiment of the targeted modification methods described above, the loss of epigenetic marks after modifying occurs in less than 0.1%, 0.08%, 0.05%, 0.02%, or 0.01% of the genome. In yet another embodiment of the targeted modification methods described above, the genome of the modified plant cell is more than 99%, e.g., more than 99.5% or more than 99.9% identical to the genome of the parent cell.

In yet another embodiment of the targeted modification methods described above, at least one of the targeted modifications is an insertion and at least one insertion is in a region of the genome that is recalcitrant to meiotic or mitotic recombination.

In certain embodiments of the plant cell genome targeting methods described above, the plant cell is a member of a pool of cells being targeted. In related embodiments, the modified cells within the pool are characterized by sequencing after targeting.

The invention also provides modified tomato plant cells comprising at least two separately targeted insertions in its genome, wherein the insertions are determined relative to a parent plant cell, and wherein the modified plant cell is devoid of mitotically or meiotically generated genetic or epigenetic changes relative to the parent plant cell. In certain embodiments, these plant cells are obtained using the multiplex targeted insertion methods described above. In certain embodiments, the modified plant cells comprise at least two separately targeted insertions, wherein the genome of the modified plant cell is at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, at least 99.5%, at least 99.9%, or at least 99.99% identical to the parent cell, taking all genetic or epigenetic changes into account.

While the introgression of certain traits and transgenes into plants has been successful, achieving a homozygous modified plant in one step (i.e., modifying all targeted loci simultaneously) has not been previously described. Plants homozygous for, e.g., targeted insertions could only be obtained by further crossing and/or techniques involving double-haploids. These techniques are not only time consuming and laborious, they also lead to plants which deviate from the original plant not only for the targeted insertion but also for other changes as a consequence of the techniques employed to enable homozygosity. As such changes could have unintended and unpredictable consequences and may require further testing or screening, they are clearly undesired in a breeding process. In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods of making a targeted mutation and/or targeted insertion in all of the 2n targeted loci in a plant genome in one step. In embodiments, the two or more loci are alleles of a given sequence of interest; when all alleles of a given gene or sequence of interest are modified in the same way, the result is homozygous modification of the gene. For example, embodiments of the method enable targeted modification of both alleles of a gene in a diploid (2n ploidy, where n=1) plant, or targeted modification of all three alleles in a triploid (2n ploidy, where n=1.5) plant, or targeted modification of all six alleles of a gene in a hexaploid (2n ploidy, where n=3) plant.

The invention also provides modified plant cells resulting from any of the claimed methods described, as well as recombinant plants grown from those modified plant cells.

In some embodiments, the invention provides a method of manufacturing a processed plant product, comprising: (a) modifying a plant cell according to any of the targeted methods described above; (b) growing a modified plant from said plant cell, and (c) processing the modified plant into a processed product, thereby manufacturing a processed plant product. In related embodiments, the processed product may be meal, oil, juice, sugar, starch, fiber, an extract, wood or wood pulp, flour, cloth or some other commodity plant product. The invention also provides a method of manufacturing a plant product, comprising (a) modifying a plant cell according to any of the targeted methods described above, (b) growing an modified plant from said plant cell, and (c) harvesting a product of the modified plant, thereby manufacturing a plant product. In related embodiments, the plant product is a product may be leaves, fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, oil, wood, flowers, cones, branches, hay, fodder, silage, stover, straw, pollen, or some other harvested commodity product. In further related embodiments, the processed products and harvested products are packaged.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure related to an on-boarding system, and more specifically related to secure on-boarding of application programming interface (API) invoker of on-boarding devices to a Common API Framework (CAPIF) Core function (CCF) server.

BACKGROUND ART

To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of 4th generation (4G) communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved 5th generation (5G) or pre-5G communication system. The 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a ‘beyond 4G network’ or a ‘post long term evolution (LTE) system’. The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, analog beamforming, and large scale antenna techniques are discussed with respect to 5G communication systems. In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud radio access networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like. In the 5G system, hybrid frequency shift keying (FSK) and Feher's quadrature amplitude modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.

The Internet, which is a human centered connectivity network where humans generate and consume information, is now evolving to the Internet of things (IoT) where distributed entities, such as things, exchange and process information without human intervention. The Internet of everything (IoE), which is a combination of the IoT technology and the big data processing technology through connection with a cloud server, has emerged. As technology elements, such as “sensing technology”, “wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure”, “service interface technology”, and “security technology” have been demanded for IoT implementation, a sensor network, a machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, machine type communication (MTC), and so forth have been recently researched. Such an IoT environment may provide intelligent Internet technology services that create a new value to human life by collecting and analyzing data generated among connected things. IoT may be applied to a variety of fields including smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car or connected cars, smart grid, health care, smart appliances and advanced medical services through convergence and combination between existing information technology (IT) and various industrial applications.

In line with this, various attempts have been made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks. For example, technologies such as a sensor network, MTC, and M2M communication may be implemented by beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of a cloud RAN as the above-described big data processing technology may also be considered to be as an example of convergence between the 5G technology and the IoT technology.

As described above, various services can be provided according to the development of a wireless communication system, and thus a method for easily providing such services is required.

The present disclosure relates to waste disposers such as food waste disposers and methods of mounting such waste disposers in relation to other structures such as sinks and, more particularly, to waste disposer assemblies or mounting assemblies of or for such waste disposers, and methods of mounting such waste disposers in relation to other structures such as sinks, by way of such waste disposer assemblies or mounting assemblies.

BACKGROUND

Food waste disposers are used to comminute food scraps into particles small enough to pass through household drain plumbing. Referring toFIG.1(Prior Art), a conventional food waste disposer10is often mounted to a sink, such as a kitchen sink (not shown), and includes a food conveying section12, a motor section14, and a grinding section16disposed between the food conveying section and the motor section. The food conveying section12includes a housing18that forms an inlet for receiving food waste and water. The food conveying section12conveys the food waste to the grinding section16, and the motor section14includes a motor imparting rotational movement to a motor shaft to operate the grinding section.

Conventional food waste disposers such as the food waste disposer10can be installed to a sink in a two-step procedure using a mounting assembly100, an example of which is shown inFIG.1in an exploded manner relative to the food waste disposer. First, a sink flange assembly102, which includes a sink (or strainer) flange104, a sink gasket106, a back-up flange108, an upper mounting flange110, bolts112, and a retaining ring114are installed or mounted in relation to the sink (which again is not shown inFIG.1). Second, a disposer assembly30including the food waste disposer10and also including a mounting (or sealing) gasket116and a lower mounting flange118are attached to the sink flange assembly102. The combination of the disposer assembly30and the mounting assembly100can be considered to constitute an overall food waste disposer assembly150.

More particularly with respect to the attachment of the disposer assembly30to the sink flange assembly102, it should be understood that the lower mounting flange118is placed around the housing18that forms the inlet of the food conveying section12. The mounting gasket116is then placed around that inlet as well, above the lower mounting flange118, in a manner tending to secure the mounting gasket116to the inlet, by virtue of a lip at the inlet of the housing18. Attachment of the disposer assembly30including the food waste disposer10to the sink flange assembly102and thereby to the sink is then particularly achieved by engaging mounting tabs120of the lower mounting flange118with ramps (or inclined mounting fasteners or edges or ridges)122of the upper mounting flange110and then rotating the lower mounting flange118relative to the upper mounting flange110until secure. When the lower mounting flange118and upper mounting flange110are secured together, the mounting gasket116is compressed therebetween, and provides a seal between the sink flange and inlet.

Although food waste disposers have long been successfully installed in relation to sinks in the manner described above (or in similar manners), mounting assemblies such as the mounting assembly100are not ideal for all applications because the mounting assemblies establish fixed connections between the food waste disposers and the sinks to which those food waste disposers are attached and consequently can communicate significant amounts of potentially-annoying vibration to the sinks from the food waste disposers when those disposers are operating. In view of this concern, alternate mounting assemblies have been developed that can at least partly isolate, in terms of the communication of vibration, food waste disposers from the sinks in relation to which those disposers are installed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,924,635, which is beneficially assigned to Taisei Corporation and entitled “Vibration Isolation Installation Mechanism For a Disposer”, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes several such embodiments of vibration isolating installation mechanisms by which disposers can be coupled to sinks.

More particularly, in several such conventional mechanisms, a flexible cylinder is employed to link upper and lower cylindrical components of the mechanism/assemblies and additionally, radially outwardly from the flexible cylinder, support rods are provided that also link the upper and lower cylindrical components. Support of the lower cylindrical component relative to the upper cylindrical component is provided by way of the support rods, which are coupled to those cylindrical components by way of elastic bushings or springs in manner that reduces the amount of vibration that can be communicated between the lower and upper cylindrical components. Correspondingly, this reduces the amount of vibration that can be communicated between a disposer supported via the lower cylindrical component and a sink to which the upper cylindrical component is connected. Although support rods are employed in some of these conventional embodiments, in at least one other conventional embodiment the support rods are omitted and the lower and upper cylindrical components are coupled with one another solely by way of the flexible cylinder.

Notwithstanding the availability of such conventional vibration isolating installation mechanisms or mounting assemblies, such conventional mechanisms/assemblies can be disadvantageous in several respects. In particular, conventional mechanisms/assemblies that employ support rods externally of the flexible cylinder can be expensive to manufacture and complicated to install, due to the multiple parts associated with the support rods, elastic bushings or springs, and/or other associated componentry. The conventional mechanisms/assemblies involving the support rods also can entail undesirably-high axial space requirements in terms of the distances between the disposers and sinks, and may not be aesthetically pleasing. Alternatively, the conventional mechanism/assembly employing the flexible cylinder without the external support rods envisions that the flexible cylinder will provide all support of the lower cylindrical component and attached disposer relative to the upper cylindrical component (and sink to which it is attached). Should the flexible cylinder rupture over time (indeed, perhaps partly due to the vibrations experience by the cylinder due to ongoing disposer operation), the disposer could detach from the sink.

Accordingly, it would be desirable if an improved food waste disposer assembly (or other waste disposer assembly), and/or an improved mounting assembly of or for such a food waste disposer assembly (or other waste disposer assembly), and/or an improved method of installing or mounting such a waste disposer assembly or mounting assembly in relation to another structure such as a sink, could be developed that alleviated or addressed one or more of the above-discussed concerns associated with conventional waste disposer assemblies, or alleviated or addressed one or more other concerns or disadvantages, or provided one or more advantages by comparison with conventional arrangements.

11904165	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates generally to virtual reality stimulation systems. In particular, the invention relates to the integration of galvanic vestibular stimulation with three dimensional video.

BACKGROUND

So-called virtual reality or enhanced reality systems such as the Rift device developed by Oculus VR present three dimensional visual stimulation to a user by displaying three dimensional video on a headset. Information representative of the orientation and/or movement of the user's head is tracked by a tracking device, and that information is used by the system to control the display of the video (e.g., so the scenes in the displayed video properly correspond to those in the direction that the user turns his or her head). It is also known to provide galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in conjunction with the visual stimulation in order to provide the user with a sense of motion or acceleration to enhance the virtual experience. Systems of these types are disclosed, for example, in the Campbell U.S. Pat. No. 5,762,612, LaValle et al. U.S. Pat. No. 9,063,30, and the Brokken et al. U.S. Patent Application Publication 2011/0044604, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties and for all purposes. GVS systems are disclosed, for example, in the Cevette et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8,718,796, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. There remains, however, a continuing need for enhanced virtual reality systems. In particular, there is need for such systems that provide enhanced integrated vestibular stimulation corresponding to the visual stimulation.

11898497	"FIELD

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to ceramic coatings (e.g., thermal barrier coatings and environmental barrier coatings) for components of turbomachinery, such as gas turbine engines.

BACKGROUND

Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are generally needed for most recent high-performance gas turbine engines. The efficiency of a combustion turbine engine improves as the firing temperature of the combustion gas is increased. As the firing temperatures increase, improved high temperature durability of the turbine components is needed. Nickel and cobalt based superalloy materials are now used extensively for components in the hot gas flow path such as combustor liners and combustor transition pieces, and turbine rotating and stationary blades (directionally solidified and single crystal). However, even these most recent superalloys are not capable of surviving long-term operation at temperatures that can sometimes exceed 1,400° C. In many applications, a metal substrate is coated with a TBC that is a ceramic insulating material to reduce the service temperature of the underlying metallic segments of the components.

The strain tolerance of TBCs used in gas turbine engines is increased by the use of pores and through-thickness cracks within the TBC produced by air plasma spray (APS) and suspension plasma spray (SPS) methods and the use of columnar TBCs produced by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD) methods. However, environmental dust, such as dust containing some combination of calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS), is often ingested into the hot sections of gas turbine engines. The dust can deposit on components in the engine and, due to the high surrounding temperatures, can become molten. The resulting low-viscosity liquid infiltrates into the engineered pores and/or columns of the TBC on the component that protects the metal substrate. Once the liquid CMAS solidifies upon cooling, the compliance of the TBC and the strain tolerance capability of the coating decrease dramatically. Coating features needed for strain tolerance are filled by the solidified CMAS.

Further, with CMAS infiltration, the stresses that are generated in the TBC can cause early spallation of the coating. Spallation of the TBC creates hot spots in the metal substrate leading to reduction in component life. The spallation in turn leads to unscheduled maintenance, as well as parts replacement resulting in increased operating costs and increased servicing costs.

Gas temperatures in the high pressure turbine section of gas turbine engines have increased in recent years, and as a result the ceramic TBCs become increasingly vulnerable to attack by molten CMAS deposits resulting from the ingestion of siliceous particulates (e.g., dust, sand, volcanic ash, debris) with the intake of air. Even when particle removal strategies are utilized, small diameter particles are still able to reach the turbine section, where they melt, and infiltrate through its interconnected network of inter-columnar pores.

Thus, an improved design of a TBC coated metal component, particularly a component for gas turbine engines, is desirable in the art.

2. Background Information

The fan blades in a fan rotor stage of a gas turbine engine can be subject to damage caused by a variety of different factors.

In any of the aspects or embodiments described above and herein, the step of controlling the light sources to selectively illuminate at least portions of the fan rotor blades and the step of controlling the cameras to capture images of the leading edge of respective fan rotor blades and produce signals representative of the captured images may be performed until the rotational speed of the fan rotor stage reaches a second predetermined rotational speed value.

I. Field of the Disclosure

The field of the disclosure relates generally to integrated circuits and more particularly to decoupling capacitors in integrated circuit packages.

II. Background

Electronic devices trend toward being smaller in size as the functional capability and performance stays the same or increases. Integrated circuit (IC) chips that power an electronic device follow the same trend. The area occupied by multiple IC chips within the same device can be reduced by vertically stacking the IC chips rather than placing them side by side on the surface of a module or carrier substrate. An IC chip with high-frequency active circuits, such as a processor, may be placed at the top (i.e., on the outside) of the stack where heat can be more easily dissipated to avoid overheating. The current requirements of a processor can change quickly in response to processor activity. Sudden changes in current draw can cause voltage droops or spikes in the voltage supplied to processor. Voltage droops and spikes can cause circuit operation to temporarily fail and may cause permanent damage to the circuits.

The problem of voltage droops and spikes can be significantly reduced by employing decoupling capacitors connected between the power supply voltage (VDD) and ground voltage (VSS) connections. The effectiveness of decoupling capacitors is diminished by the effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESL) of the decoupling capacitors. Capacitors are ideally modeled as having no resistance or inductance. ESR and ESL are the resistance and inductance of a non-ideal capacitor ESR and ESL increase with the length of the conductors connecting the decoupling capacitors to the chip power and ground inputs. Therefore, it is important to place the decoupling capacitors as close to the IC chip as possible. On the surface of a module or carrier substrate, the decoupling capacitors can be placed in close proximity to each IC chip. However, in a chip stack, the bottom chip in the stack is attached to the module or carrier substrate and conductors extend up from the module surface, through the bottom chip, to provide power and ground voltage to the processor at the top of the stack. The length of the power and ground conductors between decoupling capacitors on the module surface and the processor at the top of the stack increases voltage droop and spikes in the processor. Thus, there is a need to locate the decoupling capacitors closer to each IC chip in a stack.

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to a multilayer ceramic capacitor.

2. Description of the Related Art

"
12061197	"The invention relates to an assay for detecting infection of a subject by aFlavivirusspecies (e.g. Zika virus).

The genusFlavivirusdefines a class of viruses that includes West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus. Flaviviruses share several common aspects: size (40-65 nm), appearance (enveloped, icosahedral nucleocapsid), and positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (˜10-11 kb).

Most of these viruses are transmitted by the bite of an arthropod (mosquito or tick). Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus, and is closely related to dengue virus. Although traditionally associated with mild febrile illness, Zika virus has been recently linked with more serious conditions including Guillain-Barre syndrome and foetal microcephaly.

There has been a rapid spread of Zika virus within recent years—over 50 countries currently report active Zika virus transmission. Indeed, in view of its ability to cross to additional mosquito vectors, coupled with a multi-species animal reservoir and other modes of transmission (including sexual and transfusion-based transfer), there is significant potential for further spread. In response, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has advocated an increase inFlavivirustesting laboratory capacity in the EU, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern. There is therefore an urgent and rapidly expanding demand forFlavivirusdiagnostics.

There are, at present, no FDA-approved diagnostics for identification of Zika virus, though several diagnostic techniques have been authorised temporarily by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA), for use during the emergency response. Most of the current Zika virus diagnostic assays are RT-PCR based (RealStar® Zika Virus RT-PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics), Zika Virus RNA Qualitative Real-Time RT-PCR (Focus Diagnostics), and the Trioplex Real-time PT-PCR Assay (CDC).

Whilst existing RT-PCR based methods can provide high levels of sensitivity (with some detecting down to a single genome copy), these methods are only of value for investigation and identification of the acutely infected patient from whom body fluids may be drawn that contain virus genome. Given the short duration of viraemia and the mild clinical symptoms associated withFlavivirusinfection, very frequently the question of past infection is raised at a time that PCR diagnosis on plasma or blood samples would be unlikely to confirm a diagnosis of recent infection. In addition, from a public health point of view of monitoringFlavivirusactivity in a population, direct tests for virus are neither adequately sensitive nor cost-effective.

Moreover, a high power requirement significantly reduces portability of PCR-based methods, and can severely limit their suitability for use at the point-of-care (POC) which, in the context ofFlavivirusvirus detection, is often in remote rural locations.

Whilst serological (antibody-based) detection is relatively simple to perform and provides a readout that is easy to understand, existing assays suffer from serious cross-reactivity with relatedFlavivirusspecies (such as the endemic dengue virus, West Nile virus etc.), or previous immunisation (e.g. yellow fever vaccination), which creates major challenges in positively identifying a particularFlavivirusspecies (e.g. Zika virus) whilst discriminating between otherFlavivirusspecies. Furthermore, differential diagnosis based on symptoms alone is not possible, given the similarities in symptoms following infection with any one of theseFlavivirusspecies.

There is therefore an urgent and unmet need for a rapid, simple and field-able technology that would enable reliable identification of infection of a subject by aFlavivirusspecies.

The present invention solves one or more of the above-identified problems by providing a flexible, accurate, rapid, robust and sensitive method for detecting infection of a subject by aFlavivirusspecies.

The method of the invention is performed in vitro on a sample (e.g. blood or plasma) taken from a subject, and may be performed directly on said sample. The method is a serological assay, and therefore relies on identification of anti-Flavivirusantibody that is present in the sample. The assay provides excellent inter-species discrimination, for example allowing detection of Zika infection in a subject separately infected by dengue virus. In more detail, the method of the present invention typically comprises:1) a capture step—antibody present in the patient sample that binds to a first antigen from a firstFlavivirusspecies is immobilised;2) a quenching step—the immobilised antibody is challenged with a second antigen from a second (different)Flavivirusspecies, wherein the binding of said second antigen thereto suppresses (e.g. blocks) any inherent antigenic binding cross-reactivity of the immobilised antibody towards the secondFlavivirusspecies. This quenching step effectively allows identification of immobilised antibody that specifically binds the first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies;3) a binding step to permit detection of antibody that binds to the first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies—antibody that remains unblocked by the quenching step is challenged with labelled first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies. In the presence of antibody that binds to the first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies, labelled first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies forms a labelled complex. The antibody that binds to the first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies typically remains immobilised throughout, resulting in a labelled immobilised complex; and4) a detecting step allows the identification of the presence (or absence) of labelled complex, and thus confirmation the subject has been infected (or not) by the firstFlavivirusspecies.

For example, a pregnant subject may be screened for the accurate detection of Zika infection due to the suppression of false-positive dengue detection, and vice versa. Such accurate detection is of vital importance, given the increased risk of the presence of birth defects (e.g. microcephaly) following Zika infection compared to dengue infection, and plays an indispensable role in the decision of future treatment options.

In one aspect, there is provided use of a kit for detecting viral infection of a subject by a firstFlavivirusspecies, said kit comprising:a. a solid-phase support comprising capture means for immobilising antibody present in the sample that binds a first antigen from a firstFlavivirusspecies;b. a labelled first antigen from a firstFlavivirusspecies; andc. an unlabelled second antigen from a secondFlavivirusspecies;

wherein the first antigen and the second antigen are NS1 protein, and wherein the first and secondFlavivirusspecies are different species.

Preferably the foregoing aspects allow a distinction to be made between a viral infection in a subject by the first or secondFlavivirusspecies by specific detection of infection by the firstFlavivirusspecies.

Advantageously, the capture step leads to immobilisation of all antibodies capable of binding to the firstFlavivirusspecies. As such, the quenching step can then be adapted based on user requirements by choosing any second antigen desired.

The present invention does not require depletion/removal of cross-reactive antibody, as it provides a much simpler and more reliable quenching step. In one embodiment, a method of the invention does not comprise depleting the sample of an antibody having inherent antigenic binding cross-reactivity towards the secondFlavivirusspecies.

The first and second antigens are inter-species homologs of the same polypeptide/protein, and typically demonstrate significant common antibody binding cross-reactivity. Said first and second antigens typically demonstrate at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% sequence identity to each other along their entire length (preferably at least 90% sequence identity to each other along their entire length). Reference to a polypeptide/protein herein embraces fragments thereof having significant common antibody binding cross-reactivity.

The quenching step may comprise challenge of the immobilised antibody with second antigens from two or more secondFlavivirusspecies that are different from the firstFlavivirusspecies to be detected. Thus, the quenching step may comprise challenge with two, three, four, or more second antigens from two, three, four, or more secondFlavivirusspecies. Should two or more second antigens from different secondFlavivirusspecies be employed, said two or more second antigens are inter-species homologs of the same polypeptide/protein. Said two or more second antigens typically demonstrate at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% sequence identity to each other along their entire length. Reference to polypeptide/protein herein embraces fragments thereof having significant common antibody binding cross-reactivity.

The firstFlavivirusspecies may be selected from any one of West Nile virus, dengue virus (including dengue 1, 2, 3 or 4 virus), tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus. In a preferred embodiment the firstFlavivirusspecies is Zika virus.

The secondFlavivirusspecies may be selected from any one of West Nile virus, dengue virus (including dengue 1, 2, 3 or 4 virus), tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus, though with the proviso that said first and secondFlavivirusspecies are different. In a preferred embodiment the secondFlavivirusspecies is dengue virus (in particular dengue 3 virus). In one embodiment, the secondFlavivirusspecies is dengue virus is one or more selected from dengue 1 virus, dengue 2 virus, dengue 3 virus and dengue 4 virus, or a combination thereof (in such embodiments, said dengue 1, 2, 3 or 4 viruses may be referred to as a second, third, fourth and fifthFlavivirusspecies, respectively).

Preferably, the firstFlavivirusspecies is Zika virus and the secondFlavivirusspecies is dengue 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus. More preferably, the firstFlavivirusspecies is Zika virus and the secondFlavivirusspecies is dengue virus (in particular dengue 3 virus).

Thus, in one aspect the invention provides a method for detecting viral infection of a subject by a Zika virus, said method comprising:a. contacting a sample from said subject with a solid phase support, wherein said solid phase support includes a capture means for immobilising antibody present in the sample that binds a first antigen from a Zika virus;b. challenging (simultaneously or sequentially) said immobilised antibody with:i. a second antigen (e.g. NS1) from a dengue virus (e.g. dengue 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus), wherein the binding of said second antigen thereto suppresses (e.g. blocks) any inherent antigenic binding cross-reactivity towards the dengue virus; andii. a labelled first antigen from the Zika virus, thereby forming a labelled antigen-antibody complex;c. detecting the presence or absence of labelled complex (e.g. labelled antigen-antibody complex); andd. wherein the presence of labelled complex (e.g. labelled antigen-antibody complex) indicates viral infection of the subject by the Zika virus, and wherein the absence of labelled complex (e.g. labelled antigen-antibody complex) indicates no viral infection of the subject by the Zika virus.

The term “suppressing” embraces both reduction of and/or complete blocking of any inherent antigenic binding cross-reactivity towards the secondFlavivirusspecies (e.g. reduction of and/or complete blocking of the availability of antibody binding domains (on the immobilised antibody) capable of binding to the second antigen).

The term “immobilising” as used herein may refer to binding with an affinity (measured by the dissociation constant: Kd) of at least 10−4M, e.g. at least 10−5M, 10−6M, 10−7M, 10−8M or 10−9M. Alternatively or additionally, “immobilising” as used herein may refer to binding with an affinity (measured by way of the association constant Ka) of 106M, e.g. at least 107M or at least 108M.

The first antigen and second antigen may be selected from aFlavivirusstructural protein. For example, the first antigen and second antigen may be the nucleocapsid protein or the envelope protein. Alternatively, the first antigen and second antigen may be selected from aFlavivirusnon-structural protein. For example, the first antigen and second antigen may be the non-structural protein NS1, the first antigen and second antigen may be the non-structural protein NS2A, the first antigen and second antigen may be the non-structural protein NS2B, the first antigen and second antigen may be the non-structural protein NS3, the first antigen and second antigen may be the non-structural protein NS4A, the first antigen and second antigen may be the non-structural protein NS4B, the first antigen and second antigen may be the non-structural protein NS5, the first antigen and second antigen may be an immune modulator protein, or the first antigen and second antigen may be a protein component of the replication pathway. In more detail reference is made to:Rice, M. R. et al., (1985), Science vol. 229, p. 726-733;Heinz, F. X. & Stiasny, K. (2017), Microbiol. and Mol. Biol. Rev. vol. 81, issue 1, p. 1-27; andBosch, I. et al., (2017), Sci. Transl. Med., 9, p. 1-13

the content for each of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference thereto.

In a preferred embodiment the first antigen and second antigen is selected from NS1, NS3 or NS5, and is preferably NS1. Thus, in a preferable embodiment the first antigen and second antigen is NS1.

In one embodiment, reference to said second antigen embraces two or more (e.g. 2, 3, 4 or 5) second antigens from two or more (e.g. 2, 3, 4 or 5) secondFlavivirusspecies. In such embodiments, said antigens may be referred to as second, third, fourth, fifth etc. antigens and said (different) species may be referred to as second, third, fourth, fifth etc.Flavivirusspecies.

The second antigen may be a conjugate comprising an NS1, NS3 and/or NS5 from each of dengue 1, 2, 3 or 4 virus (e.g. a tetramer conjugate). In one embodiment, the second antigen is a conjugate comprising an NS1 from each of dengue 1, 2, 3 or 4 virus.

In one embodiment, the second antigen is a recombinant protein. In one embodiment, the second antigen is integral to a virus (e.g. viral particle), preferably an attenuated virus.

The quantity of said second antigen used in said challenging (e.g. quenching) step may be between about 1-50 μg, 5-45 μg, 10-40 μg, 15-35 μg, and more preferably 20-30 μg. Suitably, said quantity may be about 25 μg.

Any antigen label may in principle be employed. For example, the label may itself provide an observable/detectable signal (e.g. visible dye), or it may require an activation partner (e.g. horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) plus substrate). Suitably, said label is conjugated directly to the antigen (e.g. by chemical conjugation or as a fusion protein).

Examples of suitable labels include detectable labels such as radiolabels or fluorescent or coloured molecules, enzymatic markers or chromogenic markers—e.g. dyes that provide a visible colour change upon binding of the detection antibody to an antigen. By way of example, the label may be fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC), R-phycoerythrin, Alexa Fluor™ 532, CY3 or digoxigenin. The label may be a reporter molecule, which is detected directly, such as by detecting its fluorescent signal, or by exposure of the label to photographic or X-ray film. Alternatively, the label is not directly detectable, but may be detected, for example, in a two-phase system. An example of indirect label detection is binding of an antibody to the label.

In a preferable embodiment, the labelled antigen is labelled with an HRPO. Suitably, said HRPO labelled antigen is detected by means of an activation partner, e.g. a substrate that, when oxidized by HRP using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizing agent, yields a characteristic color change. Said activation partner may be one or more substrate selected from 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD), 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC), Amplex™ Red, Homovanillic acid or Luminol. Preferably, said activation partner is the substrate TMB.

Any solid phase support may in principle be employed. For example, conventional multiwall plates and lateral flow devices.

Any ligand that is able to bind immunoglobulin and leave at least one free Fab binding site (for binding to the first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies) will provide a suitable capture moiety. This may include any one of a range of different species sourced antibody to Y, a or u Fc or bacterial proteins.

In one embodiment the capture means referred to herein comprises a first antigen from a firstFlavivirusspecies. Advantageously, by using a first antigen from a firstFlavivirusspecies as a capture means (e.g. in the DABA assay described below) antibodies from different host genera or species can be detected (e.g. using the same assay). Such methods and kits may be considered particularly useful when detecting viral infection in subjects from multiple different genera or species.

In one embodiment the capture means referred to herein comprises an antibody that binds to an antibody (including an antibody that binds to a firstFlavivirusspecies) present in a sample from a subject. Suitably, said antibody binds to an Fc region of an antibody (including an antibody that binds to a firstFlavivirusspecies) present in a sample from a subject. Preferably the antibody is an anti-human antibody.

The methods of the present invention find utility in detecting either recent (e.g. new) or historic viral infection of a subject by aFlavivirus. Discriminating between recent and historic infection may be achieved by determining the type of antibody detected by a method of the invention. Thus, in some embodiments a method of the invention may comprise a step of determining the type of antibody present in a labelled antigen-antibody complex.

In one embodiment the detected antibody is an IgM antibody. IgM is typically the first antibody to appear in response to exposure of a subject to an infection, therefore detection of an IgM antibody may be indicative of a recent (e.g. new, for example within 1 month) infection by aFlavivirus. In another embodiment the detected antibody is an IgG antibody. Detection of an IgG antibody may be indicative of a historic (e.g. more than 1 month or 1-2 months after infection) infection by aFlavivirus.

The preferred antibody detection formats of the present invention are:1) DABA (direct antigen bridging assay) in which recombinant first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies is immobilised on a solid support, and presents to capture any anti-Flavivirusantibody present in the subject (patient) sample that binds to said antigen. Bound antibody is then preferably identified via a labelled equivalent of the recombinant first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies; or2) Anti-human capture antibody in which said antibody (e.g. rabbit source) is immobilised on a solid support, for example via the Fc region. Said antibody then presents Fab binding domains to capture any human antibody present in the subject sample. Thereafter, bound antibody may be identified via labelled first antigen from the firstFlavivirusspecies (as above). The anti-human capture antibody may be selected/designed so that it is, for example, specific for human IgG or human IgM antibodies (as above).

The challenging steps of a method of the invention may be carried out simultaneously or sequentially. In other words the first labelled antigen and second (or further) antigens may be added simultaneously or sequentially.

Suitably, the presence or absence of a labelled antigen-antibody complex is detected via a signal emitted from a label. Preferably, the presence of labelled antigen-antibody complex is confirmed when the signal detected is greater than a signal detected in a control assay, wherein the control assay does not comprise challenging the immobilised antibody with a labelled first antigen.

The signal detected in the control assay may be determined either prior to carrying out a method of the invention or at the same time as carrying out a method of the invention (preferably at the same time).

The skilled person understands that where the methods of the invention comprise a comparison step between two assays (e.g. between a “test assay” and a “control assay”) that conditions (e.g. assay conditions during the method) should be kept consistent. For example, the amount of sample used should be the same, as should the time conditions, etc. Where a comparison is made between two samples herein, suitably the samples are equivalent. For example, the samples being compared may be the same sample types (e.g. blood) and subjected to the same processing steps. Preferably, the samples are obtained from the same subject.

Preferably the first labelled antigen and second (or further) antigens are added simultaneously. Advantageously, such simultaneous challenging allows for the direct competition between second antigen (e.g. cold, unlabelled second antigen) and labelled first antigen for antibody binding sites. The inventors believe that this allows for competition (e.g. fluid phase competition) for antibody binding sites, in which the second antigen out-competes the labelled first antigen for binding to (undesired) immobilised antibody having inherent antigenic binding cross-reactivity towards the secondFlavivirusspecies.

In one embodiment, the sample is from a subject, typically an animal, most preferably a human. The terms “subject”, “individual” and “patient” are used interchangeably herein.

In such an embodiment, the sample is typically selected from blood (e.g. a dried blood spot), plasma, saliva, serum, sputum, urine, cerebral spinal fluid, semen, cells, a cellular extract, a tissue sample, a tissue biopsy, a stool sample, a swab from any body site and/or one or more organs; typically blood, serum, urine, saliva and/or organ(s).

In one embodiment, the sample is blood. In a preferable embodiment, the sample is serum.

A key advantage to using a blood or serum sample in methods of the present invention is that this sample is readily obtainable from a subject having or suspected of having an infection with aFlavivirusspecies and is obtained with minimal invasiveness.

In one embodiment, the sample is an arthropod (e.g. tick or mosquito) sample. In one embodiment, the sample is a mosquito sample (e.g. a processed mosquito sample). Said mosquito sample may be derived from anAedes aegypti.

In one embodiment, the sample is obtained from surgical or other medical equipment. In one embodiment, the sample is an environmental sample (e.g. water, soil and/or sediment).

In one embodiment a sample may be processed to isolate an antibody from a sample.

In one embodiment, the sample is a crude sample.

In one embodiment, the method is for use in diagnosing an infection with aFlavivirusspecies in a subject. In one embodiment, upon identification of said infection in the subject, the subject is provided with an appropriate treatment or therapy. Said treatment or therapy may be an effective dosage of a medicament to relieve symptoms of infection (e.g. acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen).

The invention is highly-suited to a number of important applications in the detection of antibody to aFlavivirusspecies. For example, the invention can help support local surveillance of antibody toFlavivirusspecies, in the animal reservoir and in humans. This enables rapid targeting of vector control measures including the prediction of emergingFlavivirusspecies epizootics before they enter the human population.

The invention allows the screening of a variety of samples, such as blood, urine, saliva and organs, and can therefore be used to test for suspected cases of infection by aFlavivirusspecies. The invention can also be used in screening travellers returning from an area affected (or an area suspected of being affected) with a particularFlavivirusspecies. The invention can also be used in testing symptomatic subjects and pregnant women, sexual health and family planning screening in affected countries.

The invention is also suitable for diagnosing infection of a subject with aFlavivirusspecies e.g. for confirming whether a subject suspected of being infected with aFlavivirusspecies is indeed infected with saidFlavivirusspecies. In one embodiment, the subject is an animal that forms part of the animal reservoir for the virus. In such instances, “infection” refers to a population of a reservoir animal that is supporting the turnover of aFlavivirusspecies.

In one embodiment, a method of the invention may further comprise recording the output of said method on a data readable format.

The term “antibody” (e.g. as it relates to an IgG capture assay of the invention) covers monoclonal antibodies and fragments thereof (e.g. exhibiting the desired biological activity). In one embodiment, an antibody of the present invention is a monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody is a fully human monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment, methods of the invention may employ polyclonal antibodies.

In particular, an antibody is a protein including at least one or two, heavy (H) chain variable regions (abbreviated herein as VHC), and at least one or two light (L) chain variable regions (abbreviated herein as VLC). The VHC and VLC regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed “complementarity determining regions” (“CDR”), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed “framework regions” (FR). The extent of the framework region and CDRs has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E. A., et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, 1991, and Chothia, C. et al, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917, 1987). Preferably, each VHC and VLC is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FRI, CDRI, FR2, DR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The VHC or VLC chain of the antibody can further include all or part of a heavy or light chain constant region. In one embodiment, the antibody is a tetramer of two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains, wherein the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains are interconnected by, e.g., disulfide bonds. The heavy chain constant region includes three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The variable region of the heavy and light chains contains a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The term “antibody” includes intact immunoglobulins of types IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes thereof), wherein the light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of types kappa or lambda. The term antibody, as used herein, also refers to a portion of an antibody that binds to one of the above-mentioned markers, e.g., a molecule in which one or more immunoglobulin chains is not full length, but which binds to a marker. Examples of binding portions encompassed within the term antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VLC, VHC, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab′)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fc fragment consisting of the VHC and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VLC and VHC domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al, Nature 341:544-546, 1989), which consists of a VHC domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) having sufficient framework to bind, e.g. an antigen binding portion of a variable region. An antigen binding portion of a light chain variable region and an antigen binding portion of a heavy chain variable region, e.g., the two domains of the Fv fragment, VLC and VHC, can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VLC and VHC regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science IAI-ATi-AIβ; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term antibody. These may be obtained using conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art, and the portions are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.

Sequence Identity

Any of a variety of sequence alignment methods can be used to determine percent identity, including, without limitation, global methods, local methods and hybrid methods, such as, e.g., segment approach methods. Protocols to determine percent identity are routine procedures within the scope of one skilled in the art. Global methods align sequences from the beginning to the end of the molecule and determine the best alignment by adding up scores of individual residue pairs and by imposing gap penalties. Non-limiting methods include, e.g., CLUSTAL W, see, e.g., Julie D. Thompson et al., CLUSTAL W: Improving the Sensitivity of Progressive Multiple Sequence Alignment Through Sequence Weighting, Position-Specific Gap Penalties and Weight Matrix Choice, 22(22) Nucleic Acids Research 4673-4680 (1994); and iterative refinement, see, e.g., Osamu Gotoh, Significant Improvement in Accuracy of Multiple Protein. Sequence Alignments by Iterative Refinement as Assessed by Reference to Structural Alignments, 264(4) J. Mol. Biol. 823-838 (1996). Local methods align sequences by identifying one or more conserved motifs shared by all of the input sequences. Non-limiting methods include, e.g., Match-box, see, e.g., Eric Depiereux and Ernest Feytmans, Match-Box: A Fundamentally New Algorithm for the Simultaneous Alignment of Several Protein Sequences, 8(5) CABIOS 501-509 (1992); Gibbs sampling, see, e.g., C. E. Lawrence et al., Detecting Subtle Sequence Signals: A Gibbs Sampling Strategy for Multiple Alignment, 262(5131) Science 208-214 (1993); Align-M, see, e.g., Ivo Van Walle et al., Align-M—A New Algorithm for Multiple Alignment of Highly Divergent Sequences, 20(9) Bioinformatics:1428-1435 (2004). Thus, percent sequence identity is determined by conventional methods. See, for example, Altschul et al., Bull. Math. Bio. 48: 603-16, 1986 and Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915-19, 1992. Briefly, two amino acid sequences are aligned to optimize the alignment scores using a gap opening penalty of 10, a gap extension penalty of 1, and the “blosum 62” scoring matrix of Henikoff and Henikoff (ibid.) as shown below (amino acids are indicated by the standard one-letter codes).

This application claims priority to German Patent Application No. DE 10 2018 205 879.2, filed Apr. 18, 2018. The contents of the aforesaid Patent Application are incorporated herein for all purposes.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a method, a device and a computer-readable storage medium with instructions for processing sensor data. The invention further relates to a motor vehicle in which a method according to the invention or a device according to the invention is used.

BACKGROUND

This background section is provided for the purpose of generally describing the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor(s), to the extent the work is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.

Modern motor vehicles to date already have a large number of sensors for various level 2 assistance systems (partially automated systems).

For level 3 and higher systems (highly automated and autonomous systems) the number of sensors installed will continue to increase. For safety reasons, there will be redundant detection areas which are covered by several sensors with different measuring principles.

Camera sensors, radar scanners and laser scanners play the most important role here. In particular, it can be assumed that at least one camera sensor and one 3D-sensor are present in critical areas to cover them. Examples of 3D-sensors are laser scanners or a radar sensor with elevation measurement.

In classic systems there exists a so-called object tracking, which sets up object hypotheses which are confirmed and updated by new sensor measurements. Traditionally, so-called “predictor-corrector filters”, such as a Kalman filter, are used. When a new measurement arises, all objects are predicted to the measurement time of the new measurement using a dynamic model. Subsequently, an attempt is made to assign the measurement to an existing object. If this succeeds, the track will be updated. If this fails, a new object hypothesis is set up, i.e., a new track.

In classic object tracking, a number of challenges must be taken into account, especially in the association step, so that ambiguities are avoided. For example, the dynamic state cannot always be estimated well: Depending on the measurements and the state of a track, a Cartesian velocity vector is often not known.

An acceleration can only be estimated through longer observation. This can lead to large errors in the prediction step. In addition, an object can behave contrary to the dynamic model, e.g., by sudden braking. This deviating behavior can also lead to prediction errors.

In addition, there are often systematic measurement errors between different sensors: A laser scanner detects e.g. highly reflective surfaces very well, such as license plates or cat's eyes, while vehicles painted black are difficult to detect. Radar sensors, on the other hand, detect metallic objects with a large radar cross-section well, such as rear lights, kinked metal sheets, etc. In this connection, different points of an object are detected by the sensors then, which may be far away from one another but are assigned to the same object. In addition, some sensors, e.g. Radar sensors, exhibit a comparatively low selectivity, so that the ambiguity problem is exacerbated here.

Incorrect handling of ambiguities can lead to incorrect associations, in which object tracks are associated and updated with incorrect measurement data. This can have unpleasant consequences. For example, a lateral speed can be wrongly assigned to a peripheral building. Thereupon, the peripheral building appears dynamic and moves into the driving envelope. This can cause an emergency stop due to a “ghost object”. It also may happen that a peripheral building, e.g., a traffic bollard measured by means of a laser scanner, is assigned to a nearby dynamic object, e.g., a vehicle that is just passing the traffic bollard. This prevents the traffic bollard from being recognized as such in time, which can lead to a collision with the peripheral building.

SUMMARY

An object exists to provide solutions for processing of sensor data enabling to reduce problems that occur during object tracking.

The object is solved by a method and by a device according to the respective independent claims. Embodiments of the invention are discussed in the dependent claims and the following description.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description, drawings, and from the claims.

1. Field

The present invention relates to the scaling of irregular low density parity check (LDPC) codes.

2. Description of the Related Art

The computer environment paradigm has shifted to ubiquitous to computing systems that can be used anytime and anywhere. As a result, the use of portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, and notebook computers has rapidly increased. These portable electronic devices generally use a memory system having memory device(s), that is, data storage device(s). The data storage device is used as a main memory device or an auxiliary memory device of the portable electronic devices. Data storage devices using memory devices provide excellent stability, durability, high information access speed, and low power consumption, since they have no moving parts. Examples of data storage devices having such advantages include universal serial bus (USB) memory devices, memory cards having various interfaces, and solid state drives (SSD).

The SSD may include flash memory components and a controller, which includes the electronics that bridge the flash memory components to the SSD input/output (I/O) interfaces. The SSD controller can include an embedded processor that can execute functional components such as firmware. The SSD functional components are device specific, and in most cases, can be updated. The two main types of flash memory components are named after the NAND and NOR logic gates. The individual flash memory cells exhibit internal characteristics similar to those of their corresponding gates. The NAND-type flash memory may be written and read in blocks (or pages) which are generally much smaller than the entire memory space. The NOR-type flash allows a single machine word (byte) to be written to an erased location or read independently. The NAND-type operates primarily in memory cards, USB flash drives, solid-state drives, and similar products, for general storage and transfer of data.

As described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,700,706 (the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference), NAND flash-based storage devices have been widely adopted because of their faster read/write performance, lower power consumption, and shock proof features. In general, however, they are more expensive compared to hard disk drives (HDD). To bring costs down, NAND flash manufacturers have been pushing the limits of their fabrication processes towards 20 nm and lower, which often leads to a shorter usable lifespan and a decrease in data reliability. As such, a more powerful error correction code (ECC) is required over traditional Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes to overcome the associated noises and interferences, and thus improve the data integrity. One such ECC is a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code.

There are different iterative decoding algorithms for LDPC codes and associated decoders, such as bit-flipping (BF) decoding algorithms, belief-propagation (BP) decoding algorithms, sum-product (SP) decoding algorithms, min-sum (MS) decoding algorithms, Min-Max decoding algorithms, etc. Multiple decoding algorithms may be used in a particular system to permit different codewords to be decoded using different decoders depending on conditions such as noise level and interference. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,337,384 (the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference), prior methods and devices have used checksum-based error processing to provide unequal error detection (UED) for error tolerant applications.

As described in U.S. Pat. No. 11,184,024 (the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference), an LDPC code can be characterized by an M×N parity-check matrix H, the column weight of the i-th (0≤i<N) column of H is the number of non-zero entries in the i-th column of the parity-check matrix H. If column weights of all columns of H are the same, the LDPC code represented by H is called a regular LDPC code. Otherwise, the LDPC code is called an irregular LDPC code. In other words, columns of the parity-check matrix H of an irregular LDPC code have different column weights.

Irregular LDPC codes are characterized by a very sparse parity-check matrix H in which the column weight may vary from column to column and the row weight may vary from row to row. The ability to allocate the column and row weights flexibly provides a useful design freedom. In fact, properly designed irregular LDPC codes tend to outperform regular LDPC codes for large block lengths; gains of up to 0.5 dB can be obtained.

Due to their flexibility and improved decoding performance, irregular LDPC codes are increasingly being used in a non-volatile memory system (e.g., a NAND flash memory) to ensure robust data storage and access.

In this context, embodiments of the present invention arise.

SUMMARY

Aspects of the invention include a decoding method. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the decoding method may include decoding data and estimating a weighted checksum on the decoded data to determine whether the decoding is successful. The weighted checksum is calculated based on a first group and a second group, the first group is associated with weights for high degree nodes of an irregular parity check matrix, and the second group is associated with weights for low degree nodes of the irregular parity check matrix.

Further aspects of the invention include a memory system. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the memory system may include a storage and a decoder in which the decoder is configured to decode data and estimate a weighted checksum on the decoded data to determine whether the decoding is successful. The weighted checksum is calculated based on a first group and a second group, the first group is associated with weights for high degree nodes of an irregular parity check matrix, and the second group is associated with weights for low degree nodes of the irregular parity check matrix.

Additional aspects of the invention include a memory controller. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the memory controller may include a receiver for receiving data and a decoder.

12011911	"BACKGROUND

The invention generally relates to sensor systems, and relates in particular to sensor systems for detecting and transferring electrical signals.

Traditionally, to pick up biomedical signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) signals, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals, various forms of ionically conductive mediums (e.g., such as hydrogels) have been used. These aqueous based signal capturing composites generally operate by relying on dissolved elements (such as salts) in the aqueous based material to ionically conduct electricity. Salts, such as sodium or potassium chloride, readily dissolve when in an aqueous medium, and their ions dissociate (separate into positive and negative ions). The dissociated ions may then convey an electrical current or signal. For this reason, salts have long been added to water, which then may be added to polymeric and elastomeric materials, to provide good electrical conductivity.

For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,508 discloses a pressure sensitive adhesive hydrogel for use in a biomedical electrode. The hydrogel material is disclosed to include at least water, potassium chloride and polyethylene glycol, and is disclosed to be electrically conductive. U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,685 also discloses an electrically conductive adhesive hydrogel that includes water, salt, an initiator or catalyst and a cross linking agent. The use of such hydrogels however, also generally requires the use of a conductive, low resistance, surface at one side of the hydrogel (away from the patient) that is capable of receiving the ionically conductive charge, such as silver / silver chloride, which is relatively expensive.

While these hydrogel/adhesives can have good electrically conductive properties, they often have only fair adhesion properties. Another downside is that the electrical conductivity changes with changes in water content, such as changes caused by evaporation, requiring that the hydrogels be maintained in a sealed environment prior to use, and then used for a limited period of time only due to evaporation. The amount of water in such composites therefore, significantly impacts the electrical properties. This presents challenges with respect to shelf life and storage environments with the aqueous based electrodes because even sealed packaging may permit some amount of evaporation over time.

Alternate technologies have been developed as taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,651,638, 8,788,009, 8,792,957, 8,673,184, 9,818,499, and 9775,235. Certain of the alternative technologies are based, in part, on non-aqueous based systems utilizing an organic polar compound that is substantially dispersed in a dielectric organic polymer. Depending upon the dielectric polymer chosen, such composites can also function as pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) to facilitate placement on a patient. Further, by careful selection of the PSA, adhesion levels can be adjusted applications from long term bonding to the skin, to less aggressive adhesion for neonatal or geriatric patients. The combination of the polar material with the polymeric dielectric material needs to avoid phase separation over time and temperature as well as when subjected to particularly high humidity conditions.

The design of an electrically conductive PSA has long presented challenges at least because adhesive strength and flexibility generally decrease with an increased presence of electrically conductive material. The materials that are typically used (added) to provide good electrical conductivity are generally less flexible and inhibit adhesion. A conventional way to prepare a conductive coating is to fill a polymeric material with conductive particles, e.g., graphite, silver, copper, etc., then coat, dry and cure the polymeric binder. In these cases the conductive particles are in such a concentration that there is a conductive network formed when the particles are each in physical contact with at least one other neighboring particle. In this way, a conductive path is provided through the composite.

For pressure sensitive adhesives, however, if the particle concentration is high enough to form a network in which particle-to-particle contact is maintained then there is little chance that the polymer (e.g., elastomer) system of the PSA component is present in high enough concentrations to flow out to make sufficient surface-to-surface contact between the substrates and an electrode, i.e., act as an adhesive. Conversely, if the PSA component is in sufficient concentration to make sufficient surface contact to the substrate, the PSA would have to interrupt adjacent conductive particles such that particle-to-particle contact is disrupted, adversely affecting electrical conductivity.

Another type of electrically conductive PSA includes conductive spherical particles with diameters equal to or greater than the thickness of the PSA. In this fashion the signal or current may be carried along the surface of the particles, thus providing current flow anisotropically in the thickness dimension of the adhesive. The continuity of the adhesive however, may be compromised due to the volume of the large spherical particles.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,082,595 discloses an electrically conductive pressure sensitive adhesive that includes carbon particles, and the conductive adhesive is disclosed to be prepared by incorporating black filler (carbon) into the pressure sensitive adhesive in such a manner as to impart electrical conductivity, yet have a concentration low enough to avoid adversely affecting the physical properties (such as tack) of the adhesive. In particular, this patent states that a slurry of the carbon black in an organic solvent is formed under mild agitation or stirring in the absence of high shear, so that carbon structures are thereby formed. The mixture may then be introduced into an adhesive. Such a composite, however, may not provide sufficient adhesiveness and conductivity in certain applications. Such composites may also include areas with relatively greater or lesser concentrations of conductive material. Certain conductive polymeric and elastomeric materials that include conductive particles in concentration within the polymeric or elastomeric material, may therefore exhibit inconsistent electrical properties over the surface of the material.

There remains a need therefore, for a composite for use as a conductive polymeric material that provides electrical conductivity without compromising the desired properties of the polymeric material, and further, there is a need for conductive polymeric materials that provide consistent electrical characteristics.

SUMMARY

In accordance with an aspect, the invention provides a non-aqueous isotropic electrically conductive signal receptive composite including a continuous conductive material, with a top surface and a bottom surface with both surfaces substantially covered by a dielectric polymer material with a polar material within the dielectric polymer.

In accordance with another aspect, the invention provides a method of making a non-hydrogel, isotropically conductive, signal receptive material. The method includes providing a continuously conductive material which is substantially covered on both sides with the mixture of a dielectric polymer and polar material.

In accordance with a further embodiment, the invention provides a signal receptive fiber material including a polar material disbursed within a polymeric material, and a conductive material within the polymeric material, the conductive material being substantially coated by the polymeric material with the polar material disbursed therein.

11927270	"This application is a 35 U.S.C. § 371 National Stage Application of PCT/DE2020/100421, filed on May 14, 2020, which claims the benefit of priority to Serial No. DE 10 2019 003 379.5, filed on May 14, 2019 in Germany, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The disclosure relates to a diaphragm seat valve.

BACKGROUND

Diaphragm valves known in the prior art generally serve for separating a control chamber from a working chamber. This serves for example for separating media during the use of different control and working media (for example gas/fluid) or for ensuring adequate hygiene requirements in hygienically sensitive requirement areas, for example for applications in the area of medicine (life science) or of food and drink production (food/beverage). The separation of the control and working chambers often serves at the same time for ensuring adequate ability for cleaning (cleaning in place, CIP) of the working chamber of residues of a working medium or adequate ability for disinfection (sterilization in place or steam in place, SIP) of the working chamber. For avoiding dead spaces and for minimizing the required cleaning or disinfection outlay, the simplest possible valve structure with the fewest possible individual parts is desirable here.

AT 262703 B has disclosed a 3/2 solenoid valve of seat-type design in which a double-seat closure piece consisting of an elastic plastic compound is formed with hose-like projections on both sides in an axial direction, wherein an actuating bar mechanism of a magnet armature engages into the hose-like projections. The diaphragm-like covering of the double-seat closure piece serves for sealing of the control part (of the magnet armature chamber) with respect to the working part of the valve for the use of highly corrosive gases or liquids. The multi-way solenoid valve disclosed by AT 262703 B has a relatively complex construction composed of small parts, wherein the double-seat closure piece has to be laboriously formed as a covering on a bar mechanism of the magnet armature. Furthermore, AT 262703 B does not disclose any technical solution for a pressure medium-based valve actuation. Finally, the sealing surfaces of the double-seat closure piece are designed as movement seals which realize frictional engagement with the corresponding sealing seats and are therefore subject to relatively significant aging for functional reasons.

DE 4308747 C2 discloses a 3/2 solenoid valve of seat-type design with a of the sealing of a magnet armature chamber with respect to a working part of the valve against aggressive working media. For sealing of the magnet armature chamber against a medium flowing through the valve, provision is made of a diaphragm formed integrally with a seal device which can be displaced in the end region along the flow and which has sealing surfaces for abutment against a valve seat, wherein an extension part of the magnet armature device protrudes as far as the region of the seal device and is in engagement therewith via a spring connection. The mixing valve disclosed by DE 4308747 C2 has a relatively complex construction composed of small parts, wherein the displaceable seal device, which has sealing surfaces for abutment against a first valve seat, is designed as a movement seal which realizes frictional engagement with the corresponding sealing seats and is therefore subject to relatively significant aging for functional reasons. Finally, DE 4308747 C2 does not disclose any technical solution for a pressure medium-based valve actuation.

DE 112011101201 B4 discloses a 3/3 solenoid valve of seat-type design with a solenoid seal for sealing of the magnet armature chamber with respect to the working part. The solenoid valve disclosed by DE 112011101201 B4 has a relatively complex construction composed of small parts for design reasons. Furthermore, the two roll-on and roll-off diaphragms are subject to relatively high wear for functional reasons. Finally, DE 112011101201 B4 does not disclose any technical solution for a pressure medium-based valve actuation.

DE 102015223943 A1 discloses a mechanically settable pressure-regulating diaphragm valve of seat-type design. The rubber-elastic diaphragm serves for separating a spring chamber from a regulating chamber and is coupled in a force-transmitting manner to a separate valve member. The solenoid valve disclosed by DE 102015223943 A1 has a relatively complex construction composed of small parts for design reasons and has a large number of dead spaces. In particular, there is inadequate cleanability and sterilizability of the regulating chamber, which is connected to the regulated secondary channel for example via a pressure-tapping channel with an only small line cross section.

DE 19711262 A1 discloses a 3/3 solenoid valve of seat-type design with a closure element composed of an elastic sealing material which is either fastened directly to an armature of a proportional magnet or is arranged directly on an actuating drive and which is formed with a stop on that side thereof which faces away from the actuating drive or the armature, said stop corresponding to a valve seat for venting. In both disclosed basic embodiments, the closure element provided according to DE 19711262 A1 has a relatively complex and wear-susceptible construction in that it is either physically fastened directly to an armature and, as a movement seal, bears, at the periphery, sealingly against a surrounding wall of a guide bore or it is designed in the manner of a diaphragm for use as a pressure-regulating valve and, on its side facing a control chamber, is designed with a second stop which serves for stiffening of the diaphragms in the area of action of the valve seat for venting and which at the same time serves as an end-position delimitation. Moreover, for realizing the 3/3-way functionality, the valve disclosed by DE 19711262 A1 is, in all the embodiment variants, altogether designed relatively complexly with a valve sleeve and multiple sealing rings and springs.

JP 2001208237 A discloses a seat valve of piston-type design whose valve piston is formed integrally with a sealing seat and which has a corrugated bellows-type portion and has an inner fluid channel. For switching of the piston, the two control surfaces thereof can be alternately acted on via an upper and a lower control chamber, with respect to which the piston is sealed off by way of an encircling sealing ring. The lower control chamber is separated from a working chamber via an additional seal collar which extends radially from the sealing seat of the piston. The seat valve disclosed by JP 2001208237 A has a relatively complex construction owing to the selected functioning and requires a relatively large structural space.

U.S. Pat. No. 2,942,837 A discloses a pressure-equalized diaphragm seat valve with a diaphragm which is arranged between two chambers. The diaphragm is formed integrally with a hollow projection which has a fluid channel and which at the same time forms a sealing seat. For ensuring an equalization of the pressure on both sides of the diaphragm, the latter is extended through by a pressure-equalization opening. Consequently, there is no separation of media between the chambers formed on both sides of the diaphragm. Furthermore, the same pressure medium, upon opening of the sealing seat formed by the diaphragm, flows through the fluid channel arranged in the sealing seat. The diaphragm seat valve disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 2,942,837 A is therefore not suitable for applications in which a separation of different control and working media is necessary for ensuring hygiene requirements.

SUMMARY

The disclosure is based on the object of avoiding the disadvantages presented. In particular, the intention is to provide a diaphragm valve with the simplest possible construction and with few components and with good cleanability of the valve regions flowed through by a working fluid.

The object is achieved according to the disclosure by a diaphragm seat valve as claimed in claim1. Advantageous refinements of the disclosure are specified in the dependent claims.

The core of the disclosure is formed by a diaphragm seat valve having a shape-elastic control diaphragm which separates a control chamber from a working chamber, in which the control diaphragm is formed integrally with a hollow projection on that side thereof which faces the control chamber or the working chamber of the diaphragm seat valve and with a diaphragm valve seat on that side thereof which faces the working chamber, wherein the interior space of the hollow projection opens out into the diaphragm valve seat, and the hollow projection is connected to a fluid channel of the diaphragm seat valve. The control diaphragm is simple to control in that the control chamber is subjected to a fluid pressure which is higher in comparison with the working chamber or an actuating force is exerted on the diaphragm from the direction of the control chamber. In this case, the control diaphragm bulges in the direction of the working chamber, wherein at the same time the diaphragm valve seat moves in this direction. In the opposite case, in which the working chamber is subjected to a pressure which is higher in comparison with the control chamber, the control diaphragm bulges in the direction of the control chamber, wherein at the same time the diaphragm valve seat moves in this direction. In the second movement direction of the diaphragm valve seat, a fluid connection via the interior space of the hollow projection to that fluid channel of the diaphragm seat valve to which the hollow projection is connected can be opened up. With the diaphragm seat valve according to disclosure, a reduction in components is achieved in that a valve seat is integrated directly into the control diaphragm itself. The integration of a hollow projection connected to a fluid channel at the same time avoids dead spaces. The diaphragm seat valve according to the disclosure has good ability for cleaning of all the valve regions flowed through by a working fluid, since the interior space of the hollow projection and the diaphragm valve seat formed by the control diaphragm can be flushed in a simple manner. The control diaphragm, together with the functional parts formed thereby, can be produced structurally easily and inexpensively integrally as an elastomer and/or plastic molded part. In particular, the control diaphragm, with the hollow projection and the diaphragm valve seat, can be produced in a simple manner as an elastomer in a single primary forming or forming manufacturing step.

A connection of the hollow projection to the fluid channel is achieved in a simple manner in that the hollow projection is formed such that it can be plugged into an opening of the fluid channel or can be plugged onto this.

In a simple configuration, the diaphragm seat valve is preferably designed with a movable closure element which comprises a first closure means which corresponds to the diaphragm valve seat.

In a structurally simple embodiment, the closure element is mounted in an axially movable manner against the diaphragm valve seat. If the control chamber is subjected to a fluid pressure which is higher in comparison with the working chamber or if an actuating force is exerted on the control diaphragm from the direction of the control chamber, the control diaphragm bulges in the direction of the working chamber, wherein at the same time the diaphragm valve seat and the first closure means, which corresponds to said valve seat and which is axially movably mounted, move in this direction. If the working chamber is subjected to a pressure which is higher in comparison with the control chamber, the control diaphragm bulges in the direction of the control chamber, wherein at the same time the diaphragm valve seat moves in this direction. In the second movement direction of the diaphragm valve seat, a fluid connection via the interior space of the hollow projection to the fluid channel can be opened up.

For simplifying the return movement and for improving the sealing seat, the closure element is designed so as to be spring-loaded against the diaphragm valve seat.

For realizing a 3-way functionality, the closure element is preferably in the form of a double closure element which, on its side facing away from the control diaphragm, is formed with a second closure means which corresponds to a second valve seat formed in the diaphragm seat valve.

In an embodiment as a 3/3-way valve, a second working chamber is arranged below the second valve seat, and the double closure element extends through the second valve seat in that the second closure means acts sealingly against the second valve seat, or engages into it, on the side facing the second working chamber. If, in this embodiment, the control chamber is subjected to a fluid pressure which is higher in comparison with the working chamber or if an actuating force is exerted on the control diaphragm from the direction of the control chamber, the control diaphragm bulges in the direction of the working chamber, wherein at the same time the diaphragm valve seat and the double closure element, which corresponds to said valve seat and which is axially movably mounted, move in this direction. In this case, the second closure means lifts off from the second valve seat and opens up a fluid connection between the working chamber and the second working chamber. Upon removal of the excess pressure or the actuating force, the control diaphragm and the double closure element return to their starting position again, so that the fluid connection is closed again. If the working chamber is subjected to a pressure which is higher in comparison with the control chamber, the control diaphragm bulges in the direction of the control chamber, wherein at the same time the diaphragm valve seat moves in this direction and opens up a fluid connection between the working chamber and the fluid channel.

In a structurally simple embodiment, the the double closure element has the shape of a dumbbell, wherein the first closure means and the second closure means each have a spherical shape.

In a structurally simple embodiment, the control diaphragm is designed such that it can be controlled electromagnetically via the control chamber. In this case, on that side of the control diaphragm which faces the control chamber, an electromagnetically movable actuating element preferably acts on said control diaphragm.

In an alternative structurally simple embodiment, the control diaphragm can be subjected to a control pressure via the control chamber.

12018915	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to the field of crossbows. More specifically, the invention relates to a crossbow scope with built-in laser rangefinder. The scope features an integrated laser rangefinder, selectively activated via a button positioned on the crossbow to which the scope is attached. The laser emitted by a laser source of the scope is used by a range sensor for determining actual distance and tilt from a target and allows a user to maximize their accuracy while hunting, shooting competition and more. The scope can be integrated or retrofitted to existing crossbows. Accordingly, the present disclosure makes specific reference thereto. Nonetheless, it is to be appreciated that aspects of the present invention are also equally applicable to other like applications, devices and methods of manufacture.

BACKGROUND

By way of background, bows and arrows, spears, crossbows, guns, and artillery have been used for sport, hunting and military. More specifically, a crossbow is a ranged weapon using an elastic launching device consisting of a bow-like assembly called a prod. Crossbows are often used for hunting and recreational purposes and require a higher degree of stealth and sheer effort to get into position to make the shot. Therefore, precision and accuracy of the shot is difficult. This becomes more difficult due to absence of a rangefinder in conventional crossbows. Individuals generally end up missing a target which may cost them a trophy or a prey. A rangefinder is therefore desired by individuals for improving their shots before competitions and during hunts.

Using conventional crossbows can be dangerous for other individuals as the user using the crossbow may miss the target by a long distance. Individuals desire a device that can assist them with making an accurate shot.

Many individuals enjoy hunting using crossbows and the hunting experience with conventional crossbows is generally disappointing as the individuals can't find and accurately shoot long distance animals. Individuals desire a rangefinder that can be used with their crossbows and used for long distance shots.

Therefore, there exists a long felt need in the art for a rangefinder scope that can be used with conventional crossbows. There is also a long felt need in the art for a crossbow rangefinder scope that can be used for long distance shots. Additionally, there is a long felt need in the art for a scope that can be easily activated by a user using the crossbow. Moreover, there is a long felt need in the art for a rangefinder scope that can be used for all purposes ranging from competitions and target practice to hunting live animals. Further, there is a long felt need in the art for a rangefinder scope for crossbows that help individuals in improving their shots. Finally, there is a long felt need in the art for a crossbow rangefinder scope that enables users to adjust their shot to accommodate a long-range arc to hit a target at a long range distance and improve the accuracy of same.

The subject matter disclosed and claimed herein, in one embodiment thereof, comprises a crossbow scope with a built-in laser rangefinder. The crossbow scope features a laser rangefinder mechanism including a laser diode for transmitting a laser beam towards a target, a range sensor for detecting range and tilt of the crossbow scope relative to the target, a laser reticle for displaying laser beam projection relative to the target image on an eyepiece of the scope, an activation button disposed on the crossbow to which the scope is attached wherein the button is coupled to the scope and is configured to activate the scope when pressed. In use, users can press the button, activate the rangefinder and adjust their crossbow position to accommodate the laser reticle within the sight.

In this manner, the crossbow scope with built-in laser rangefinder of the present invention accomplishes all of the forgoing objectives and provides users with a crossbow rangefinder scope that can be used for long distance shots with conventional crossbows. The rangefinder uses a laser which can be used for all purposes ranging from competitions to hunting animals. The crossbow rangefinder scope enables users to adjust their shot to accommodate a long-range arc to hit a target at long range distances and improves the accuracy of same.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed innovation. This summary is not an extensive overview, and it is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some general concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

The subject matter disclosed and claimed herein, in one embodiment thereof, comprises a crossbow scope with a built-in laser rangefinder.

11938259	"BACKGROUND

Field of the Disclosure

The disclosure relates to blood treatment systems and methods. More particularly, the disclosure relates to systems and methods for combining an adsorption device and a blood separation system.

Description of Related Art

Various blood processing systems now make it possible to collect particular blood constituents, rather than whole blood, from donors or patients. Typically, in such systems, whole blood is drawn from a donor, the particular blood component or constituent is removed and collected, and the remaining blood constituents are returned to the donor. By thus removing only particular constituents, potentially less time is needed for the donor's body to return to pre-donation levels, and donations can be made at more frequent intervals than when whole blood is collected. This increases the overall supply of blood constituents, such as plasma and platelets, made available for health care.

Whole blood is typically separated into its constituents through centrifugation. This requires that the whole blood be passed through a centrifuge after it is withdrawn from, and before it is returned to, the donor. To avoid contamination and possible infection of the donor, the blood is preferably contained within a sealed, sterile fluid flow system during the entire centrifugation process. Typical blood processing systems thus include a permanent, reusable centrifuge assembly containing the hardware (drive system, pumps, valve actuators, programmable controller, and the like) that spins and pumps the blood, and a disposable, sealed and sterile fluid processing assembly that is mounted in cooperation on the hardware. The centrifuge assembly engages and spins a disposable centrifuge chamber in the fluid processing assembly during a blood separation step. The blood, however, makes actual contact only with the fluid processing assembly, which assembly is used only once and then discarded.

As the whole blood is spun by the centrifuge, the heavier (greater specific gravity) components, such as red blood cells, move radially outwardly away from the center of rotation toward the outer or “high-G” wall of a separation chamber included as part of the fluid processing assembly. The lighter (lower specific gravity) components, such as plasma, migrate toward the inner or “low-G” wall of the separation chamber. Various ones of these components can be selectively removed from the whole blood by forming appropriately located channeling seals and outlet ports in the separation chamber of the fluid processing assembly. For example, one application of therapeutic plasma exchange involves separating plasma from cellular blood components, collecting the plasma, and returning the cellular blood components and a replacement fluid to the donor.

After the blood has been separated into its constituent parts, it may be desirable to further process one more of the separated components. For example, in an alternative version of a therapeutic plasma exchange procedure, rather than replacing a patient's plasma with a different fluid, the patient's own plasma may be treated and returned after separation. This may be most efficiently achieved by pairing the blood separation system with a secondary processing device, such as an adsorption device or column. The adsorption device will remove undesirable substances from the plasma by immuno-adsorption. The exact substances removed depend upon the needs of the patient. For example, the substances removed from the plasma by the adsorption device may include low-density lipoproteins and Lipoprotein(a) for patients suffering from severe hypercholesterolemia. In another example, pathogenic antibodies may be removed from the plasma, for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases and organ transplant rejection, or as a pre-treatment before transplantation. In yet another example, fibrinogen, fibrin, and/or C-reactive protein may be removed from the plasma, for treating microcirculation disorders and ischemic tissue damage. Exemplary adsorption devices include the TheraSorb® line of products from Miltenyi Biotec GmbH Corporation of Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. Other examples of adsorption devices suitable for removing undesirable substances from plasma are described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,569,112 to Strahilevitz, which is incorporated herein by reference.

One disadvantage of known systems which combine a blood separation system with an adsorption device is the amount of manual intervention and oversight required. Typically, an operator must monitor the adsorption device to ensure that a suitable amount of plasma is entering the adsorption device, so as to not overload the device. If the operator does not properly monitor the adsorption device, plasma will not be properly processed and may be returned to the patient without having the undesirable substances removed therefrom. Furthermore, when using “active” adsorption columns the operator must actively monitor any reservoir bags to ensure that large amounts of blood components are not removed from the patient without proper component replacement, as decreased effective circulating volume (“ECV”) can severely compromise a patient's health. Accordingly, the need remains for blood treatment systems and methods which combine the separation and further processing functions while eliminating or at least reducing the amount of manual intervention and oversight required.

The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 of German Patent Application No. 10 2020 007 090.6, filed Nov. 19, 2020, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The invention relates to a method for authenticating a ventilator with respect to remote stations.

2. Discussion of Background Information

In the case of data transfer between ventilator and servers, as in the case of remote monitoring or telemedicine, highly sensitive data are sometimes transferred, which can include, among other things, data on the health status and the treatment of a patient. It is essentially important here that the ventilators are also assigned a corresponding user upon the data transfer. Several identification methods are known for this purpose from the prior art, which do permit identification of the ventilator, but a secure check of the authenticity of the identity is not provided here, so that other data sources can also impersonate the ventilator and thus, for example, transfer false data.

If one of the hardware components, in particular special components, which are specially configured, is defective, this can result in further problems with respect to the identification, in particular since identification features are also lost due to the defective hardware component.

In view of the foregoing, it would be advantageous to have available a method which enables the secure transfer of data of a ventilator.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a method for authenticating at least one ventilator with at least one remote station, wherein the ventilator can connect itself via at least one interface to the remote station, wherein at least one authentication file is stored on the ventilator, wherein the authentication file contains at least one signature code of a signing authority and a public keycode of the signing authority is known to the remote station, wherein the ventilator sends the authentication file to the remote station when establishing a connection to the remote station, wherein the remote station checks the signature code of the authentication file using the public keycode as to whether the signature code originates from the signing point, and wherein the ventilator is authenticated when the remote station recognizes the signature code as originating from the signing authority.

In some embodiments of the method, therapeutic data are transferred from the ventilator to the remote station after and/or during the establishment of the connection, wherein the therapeutic data are only processed by the remote station when the ventilator is authenticated. Therapeutic data can thus already be transferred in parallel with the authentication file. However, these data are only processed when the authentication of the ventilator has been carried out.

In some embodiments of the method, the connection from the ventilator to the remote station is only established and/or accepted and/or maintained if the remote station recognizes the signature code as originating from the signing authority and the ventilator is authenticated.

In some embodiments of the method, therapeutic data transferred from the ventilator to the remote station are discarded by the remote station if the remote station does not recognize the signature code as originating from the signing authority.

In some embodiments of the method, the signing authority creates the authentication file and adds the signature code to the authentication file using a private key of the signing authority.

In some embodiments of the method, in addition to the signature code, the authentication file contains at least one identification number of the ventilator, wherein the remote station recognizes the ventilator on the basis of the identification number and assigns it to a user.

In some embodiments of the method, the ventilator generates a request file to request the creation of an authentication file by the signing authority, wherein the request file contains at least the identification number of the ventilator.

In some embodiments of the method, in addition to the request file, the ventilator creates an information file, which contains at least the identification number of the ventilator and at least one identification number of at least one hardware component of the ventilator, wherein the request file and the information file are transferred to a checking unit, the combination of the identification numbers contained in the information file is checked for validity and if the combination of the identification numbers is valid, the checking unit passes on the request file to the signing authority and the signing authority generates the authentication file using the request file.

In some embodiments of the method, the transferred combination of the identification numbers is entered in a database if a combination having an identification number of a hardware component is not yet entered with the identification number of the ventilator. If a combination of the identification number of the ventilator with the identification number of a hardware component is entered, which does not correspond to the transferred combination of the identification numbers, the transferred combination is assessed as nonvalid and the request file is not passed on to the signing authority.

In some embodiments of the method, upon replacement of the hardware component, a new request file is created by the ventilator using at least one identification number of the new hardware component and the identification number of the ventilator.

In some embodiments of the method, the new combination of identification number of the new hardware component and identification number of the ventilator is checked for validity, wherein in the event of a valid new combination of the identification numbers, the request file is transferred to the signing authority, wherein the signing authority creates a new authentication file and adds a signature code to the new authentication file using the private keycode and the new authentication file is then transferred to the ventilator.

In some embodiments of the method, the new combination of ventilator and new hardware component or the identification numbers thereof is checked directly in the signing authority.

In some embodiments of the method, the old combination of the identification numbers of the ventilator and the old hardware component is marked as invalid after replacement of the old hardware component with the new hardware component.

In some embodiments of the method, combinations of ventilators and hardware components marked as invalid are made available to the remote station.

In some embodiments of the method, from time to time the remote station retrieves combinations which are made available and marked as invalid, wherein the remote station does not accept a connection to a ventilator which wishes to authenticate itself using an authentication file which was created using an invalid combination, so that no connection is established between the ventilator and the remote station.

In some embodiments of the method, from time to time the remote station retrieves combinations which are made available and marked as invalid, wherein the remote station does not accept a connection to a ventilator which wishes to authenticate itself using an authentication file which was created using an invalid combination, so that no transfer of therapeutic data takes place between the ventilator and the remote station and/or the therapeutic data sent from the ventilator to the remote station are not processed by the remote station and/or are discarded by the remote station.

In some embodiments of the method, the remote station generates a message in the event of an authentication attempt of a ventilator using an authentication file made up of an invalid combination of hardware component and ventilator.

In some embodiments of the method, the remote station, in the event of an authentication attempt of a ventilator using an authentication file made up of an invalid combination, transmits a command to the ventilator, which blocks the usage of the ventilator and displays a service message on a display unit of the ventilator.

In some embodiments of the method, a private keycode and a public keycode for the ventilator are generated by the hardware component and the public keycode is transferred as part of the request file to the signing authority, wherein the public keycode is used to encrypt data which are sent to the ventilator and the data encrypted using the public keycode of the ventilator can only be decrypted using the private keycode of the ventilator.

In some embodiments of the method, the remote station has a private keycode and a public keycode, wherein the public keycode is made available to the ventilator as part of an authentication file, wherein the ventilator encrypts data which are transferred from the ventilator to the remote station using the public keycode and wherein the data which were encrypted using the public keycode can only be decrypted using the private keycode.

In some embodiments of the method, the authentication file is created by the signing authority and the signing authority adds a signature code to the authentication file using the private keycode, wherein the ventilator checks the signature code using the public keycode and only accepts the authentication file if the signature code is recognized as originating from the signing authority.

In some embodiments of the method, the hardware component is a mainboard.

The present invention also provides a system comprising at least one ventilator and at least one remote station, wherein the ventilator is configured to establish a connection to the remote station via at least one interface and wherein at least one authentication file is stored on the ventilator, which contains at least one signature code of a signing authority, wherein a public keycode of the signing authority is known to the remote station, wherein the ventilator sends the authentication file to the remote station when establishing a connection to the remote station, wherein the remote station checks the signature code of the authentication file using the public keycode as to whether the signature code originates from the signing point, and wherein therapeutic data are only transferred and/or processed and/or the connection is only established and/or accepted if the remote station recognizes the signature code as originating from the signing authority.

The system is configured and designed to carry out the described method and/or individual method steps.

It is to be noted that the features listed individually in the claims can be combined with one another in any technically reasonable manner and disclose further embodiments of the invention. The description additionally characterizes and specifies the invention in particular in conjunction with the figures.

It is furthermore to be noted that a conjunction “and/or” which is used herein, stands between two features, and links these features to one another is always to be interpreted to mean that in a first embodiment of the subject matter according to the invention, only the first feature can be present, in a second embodiment only the second feature can be present, and in a third embodiment both the first and also the second feature can be present.

Ventilators can be understood as devices in the form of ventilators and diagnostic devices. Diagnostic devices can be used in general to acquire medical parameters of a patient. These also include devices which can acquire and optionally process medical parameters of patients in combination with or exclusively relating to the respiration. A ventilator is to be understood as any device which assists a user or patient in the natural respiration, takes over the respiration of the user or patient and/or is used for respiratory therapy and/or influences the respiration of the user or patient in another manner. These include, for example, but not exclusively, CPAP and bilevel devices (sometimes also known as BiPAP), anesthesia devices, respiratory therapy devices, (clinical, nonclinical, or emergency) ventilators, high flow treatment devices, and coughing machines.

An interface is to be understood in the broadest meaning as any type of device for connection—independent of the type of connection—between the ventilator and a remote station or a person. An interface for a connection between the ventilator and a person can be, for example, a user interface which enables the interaction between person and ventilator directly at the ventilator. Further interfaces can be, for example, interfaces for wireless connection over short (for example, Bluetooth, WPAN, etc.) and/or long distances (mobile wireless, UMTS, 3G, LTE, 5G, WiFi, WLAN, etc.), interfaces for wired connections (inter alia, LAN, USB connections, direct connections to computers, sensors, diagnostic and medical devices), and also plug connections (socket for SD cards, USB terminal, etc.).

The individual components of the ventilator can be divided into modules, wherein the entire ventilator can also be understood as a single module. The definition of a module can be carried out under various aspects which are not explained in more detail at this point and have no influence on the invention as such. An overlap of various modules by the components of the ventilator is also possible here. One component can thus be assigned to two modules, for example. Furthermore, the individual modules can also be combined into module groups, wherein these module groups can also have overlaps under certain circumstances.

The source of a data input can have various forms, but generally results in an electrical signal which can be processed inside the ventilator. For example, the data input can take place mechanically via a user interface in the form of a touch-sensitive display screen. The mechanical touch is converted into an electrical signal, which can be processed in the ventilator, via the touch-sensitive display screen. However, an electrical signal can also be input directly via other interfaces, for example. A precise description of all possible ways of actuating a data input at the ventilator and/or transmitting it via an interface will be omitted at this point, since the form of the data input has no relevance for the method according to the invention or the device according to the invention.

During the handling of the authentication, the ventilator receives a certificate which is used for the authentication of the ventilator and optionally also for the encryption of data using a private key. For this purpose, for example, a corresponding authentication file, thus ultimately a certificate, is created for the ventilator and signed accordingly. The signing, for example by adding a corresponding signature code, is generally carried out by a trustworthy signing authority (certification authority, CA). The authentication is necessary, for example, so that it can be ensured that the data transferred from the ventilator to the remote station also actually originate from the ventilator and it is not pretended that the ventilator sends the data.

During the production of the ventilator, a combination, inter alia, made up of the identification number of the ventilator (for example the serial number of the ventilator), an identification number of a hardware component, and a credential (for example a signature code or a public keycode (public key)) is generated or defined and stored in a database. The identification number of a hardware component can be, for example, the serial number of the mainboard and/or any other individual number/designation of a component, for example serial numbers of a single chip. The validity of this combination can thus be checked again at any later point in time.

If the hardware component, the identification number of which was used to create the authentication, is defective and has to be replaced, initially an invalid combination occurs since it was not yet known during the production of the hardware component (for example mainboard) in which ventilator having which identification number (for example serial number) the hardware component would later be installed. The credential/the keycode (public and private key) for the combination is also not yet created. Therefore, for example, the following steps follow the replacement: Initially the old combination is deregistered from the database by specifying identification number of the ventilator and the hardware components. The replacement of the hardware components is thus enabled at the same time. The identification number of the new hardware components and of the ventilator is then input into the ventilator via an interface (for example, keyboard, touchscreen, etc.). A communication of the combination to a remote station, for example a (credential) server, can then take place via a (different) interface, so that a new credential for the combination is created and/or a corresponding certificate is created/signed. The new combination is also stored in the database.

If the actual private credentials should additionally be made public, for example, due to a data security leak, a new, private credential can thus also be created via this path.

Each ventilator receives a personal certificate (authentication file) during the production, which contains, inter alia, the device serial number (identification number of the ventilator). It is later possible using this certificate that the ventilator can be identified and also authenticated—for example, during online communication or the validation of the therapy data.

The steps required for this purpose are carried out by a test stand PC (checking unit).

The certificate is created as follows:1. The ventilator has items of information set about the device serial number2. The ventilator itself generates a key pair and stores the private key so that it can never be read out3. The ventilator creates a certificate request (CSR, certificate signing request) therefrom4. The checking unit receives the request and sends this request to the PKI server5. The PKI server creates the certificate based on the request6. The PC imports/transfers the certificate to the ventilator

Additional items of information about individual components installed in the device are made available to the PKI server.

With the aid of this certificate and the stored key pair, the device can authenticate itself using various modern technologies.

The replacement of a hardware component, the identification number of which was used for generating the authentication file, is described briefly hereinafter on the basis of the example of the mainboard, wherein the process is also transferable to other replaceable components.

After replacement of the mainboard, the device serial number is not to be changed, since among other things the serial number is often used to assign patients to ventilators. The replacement of the mainboard can take place outside the production site, for example at a distributor or service provider, who cannot issue trustworthy certificates or cannot have a trustworthy connection to the PKI of the producer.

Therefore, a method has been developed which opens up the possibility that the customer or distributor can reuse the original serial number after the mainboard has been replaced and can receive a new certificate from the producer without special software or equipment being necessary for the customer/distributor.

Mainboards which are used as replacement mainboards are produced separately as replacement parts and pass through a special final process. During the production of the replacement mainboard, the PKI service already receives items of information about the produced replacement mainboard. The PKI service can be a server which processes everything automatically, but can also comprise persons who carry out individual steps.

During the production, an initialization PC/a checking unit shares the public key (public keycode) and the serial number (identification number) of the replacement mainboard with the PKI service. The following steps are carried out:

Production of the replacement mainboard1. The checking unit initializes the replacement mainboard and activates the firmware2. Software is started on this mainboard which generates the key pair (private and public key) and shares items of information about the public key and the serial number of various mainboard components and the mainboard itself with the checking unit. This can take place, for example, via a file (for example in the JSON format) of the checking unit.3. The checking unit sends these items of information to the PKI service.

Replacement of the mainboard:1. The defective mainboard is removed, for example by a technician, and a replacement mainboard is installed.2. The ventilator is started and the (same) serial number of the ventilator is input via an interface.3. The ventilator generates a request to create/sign a certificate.4. The serial number (identification number) of the defective mainboard and of the individual components of the mainboard is transferred together with the certificate request (the request file) to the PKI service. For example via email, but it can also take place fully automatically.5. At the PKI service, it is checked whether the serial number of the components of the old mainboard was combined with the serial number of the ventilator which is to receive a new certificate and whether the public key of the installed replacement mainboard is valid and was acquired during the production at the producer.6. The certificate is thereupon created based on the new CSR by the PKI service, signed, and stored in a file.7. The file is transferred to the person who replaces the mainboard and the ventilator can read out and accept the new certificate via an SD card.

According to the invention, it can also be provided that the remote station which is or will be connected to the ventilator also has an authentication file which comprises a signature code generated by the signing point. The ventilator can authenticate the remote station via this signature code.

The authentication according to the invention can also be used, for example, to sign and/or encrypt configuration data for the ventilator. In this case, configuration data are transferred from the remote station to the ventilator. The configuration data are signed, for example, upon creation by the remote station. The ventilator can check the validity and/or integrity and/or the authorization of the configuration data via the signature (for example the signature code). The transfer can take place, for example, via one of the interfaces online (data connection via modem, network, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) or also off-line (storage medium, file, USB, etc.). In some embodiments, it can be provided that the configuration data are created by a different remote station than the one via which the configuration data are transferred to the ventilator. For example, the configuration data can be created at a PC which signs the configuration data using the signature code of the PC, wherein the signature code of the PC can be checked by the ventilator to check the authenticity of the configuration data. The configuration data are then transferred, for example, via a server to the ventilator, wherein the server additionally has to authenticate itself at the ventilator and the ventilator also authenticates itself at the server. For example, it can thus be ensured that the configuration data are transferred to the correct ventilator. In some embodiments, it is thus also ensured that the configuration data are only transferred to the intended ventilator.

Alternatively or additionally, it can also be provided that the configuration data are encrypted with the aid of the public key of the ventilator. For example, it can thus be ensured that the configuration data can only be accepted or used by a single ventilator.

The method according to the invention can also be transferred to software modules, for example a firmware update. The software modules are signed accordingly for this purpose, so that the ventilator can authenticate the origin of the software module. In some embodiments, it is optionally provided according to the invention that the ventilator has to authenticate itself at the remote station so that the software module and/or configuration data are transferred. For example, it can thus be ensured that the provided software modules and/or configuration data are only transferred to the intended ventilator.

It can also be provided in software modules which are to be transferred to the ventilator that the software modules are encrypted using the public key of the ventilator, so that only the intended ventilator can use the provided software modules.

In some embodiments, it can be provided that the ventilator comprises functions which are optionally blocked. It can be provided for this purpose that these functions are unlocked, for example, via configuration data. As explained above, these configuration data can be signed and/or encrypted accordingly, so that it can be checked by the ventilator whether the unlocking is permitted. For example, the authenticity of the origin of the configuration data is checked. In some embodiments, the configuration data can also contain data for unlocking an expert and/or service mode. An expert and/or service mode permits, for example, the access to expanded setting options, which are not supposed to be available to a user/patient.

In some embodiments, for example, configuration data can be contained on a data carrier which contain the unlocking of the expert and/or service mode. The ventilator can check the authenticity of the unlocking according to the signature and unlock the respective mode. It can also be provided, for example, that the mode is only activated as long as the data carrier is connected to the ventilator. This can also apply similarly to distant remote stations, the expert and/or service mode only remains activated as long as the distant remote station is connected to the ventilator. It can optionally also be provided that such an expert and/or service mode can be activated/deactivated via the distant remote station, in some embodiments also independently of the connection status between remote station and ventilator.

In some embodiments, it can also be provided that unlocking and/or configuration of modes can take place via the certificate or the authentication file itself. For example, a ventilator can provide the technical conditions for an APAP operation, but is initially configured as a CPAP device. The authentication file can for this purpose contain, in addition to one or more identification numbers, also an item of information as to the type of ventilator the device is to be configured as. For example, the ventilator receives an updated certificate having the new items of information for this purpose. Alternatively or additionally, it can also be provided that a corresponding unlocking code is contained in the certificate or the authentication file which is downloaded onto the ventilator.

The method according to the invention also permits, inter alia, a unique identification of the ventilator and a simultaneous authentication. It can thus also be ensured, for example, that in addition to the origin of the data from the ventilator, data which are exclusively intended for the ventilator can also be accurately transferred. If the ventilator authenticates itself, for example, at a remote station or is authenticated by the remote station, it can also be checked again via the unique identification whether data for the ventilator are present and are to be transferred.

Alternatively or additionally, the method according to the invention can also be used to implement an authorization between the user of the ventilator and a remote station on the basis of a “challenge-response” method. For example, the user uses a remote station, such as a smart phone having an app, together with the ventilator and also wishes to connect via the app to another remote station, for example a server and/or a remote support. The certificate of the ventilator can thus also be used for the authentication of the user of the ventilator. It can be ensured at the remote station by the signing and/or encryption of a “challenge” requested by the remote station that the user of the remote station is in possession of a single ventilator—for example having a specific serial number (identification number)—and access to certain functions and/or privileges can be allowed to him. For example, it can thus also be ensured that messages are transferred securely between user and caregiver.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a swing door operator for moving a swing door leaf in a swing path between an open and closed position, a swing door and a room with a swing door. More specifically, the disclosure relates to a swing door operator for moving a swing door leaf in a swing path between an open and closed position, a swing door and a room with a swing door as defined in the introductory parts of claim1, claim14and claim15.

BACKGROUND ART

Doors that open automatically are widely used throughout the modern society, especially in public buildings and offices. When automated doors are used in narrow compartments, as e.g. public toilets, the automated door is often equipped with a sensor for preventing the door from closing if a person is standing in the way of the door leaf In that way it is prevented that a person gets hit by the door leaf. Such a solution may, however, lead to that the sensor detects a person inside the narrow compartment and the door will not close since current sensors normally maintain its sensor detection field independent of door angle. This means that there is a safety field of a minimum of 200 mm from the door into the narrow compartment when the door is almost closed. The problem has been solved by ignoring the signal from the sensor when the door closes its last part of the closing cycle, which increases the risk of injury to the person inside the narrow compartment.

There is thus a problem in the industry when it comes to safety during the closing cycle of automatic doors. Further, the user experience is affected when an automatic door re-opens or the closing is delayed when the user is inside the room but close enough to the door to trigger the detector.

SUMMARY

It is an object to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above-identified deficiencies in the art and disadvantages singly or in any combination and solve at least the above mentioned problem. According to a first aspect there is provided a swing door operator for moving a swing door leaf in a swing path between an open and closed position, the swing door operator comprising at least one drive unit being arranged to move the swing door leaf between the open and closed position, the swing door operator further comprising a control unit being operatively connected to the drive unit and a first sensor, wherein the first sensor is configured to identify objects in front of a first side of the swing door leaf, the control unit is configured to react if an object is identified by the first sensor in a safety zone in front of the first side of the swing door leaf, the control unit is configured to adapt the size/area of the safety zone based on the swing path of the swing door leaf and the position of the swing door leaf.

The safety zone may thus be limited to the area in from of the first side of the door leaf in which area the door will travel during its path between an open and closed position during the closing operation of the door leaf. The safety zone is thus e.g. formed as a circle sector limited by the door leaf and the closed position or doorway/doorframe. This leads to the advantage that the safety zone can be active during the entire closing procedure of the door while still allowing a person inside a narrow compartment, as e.g. a toilet, to use the full space within the compartment without being detected by the first sensor. Also, there is no chance of the automatic door re-opening or delaying the closing due to a user that is fully inside the compartment but close to the doorway.

According to some embodiments, the swing door comprises a door position sensor to keep track of the position of the door at all times. The door position sensor may be an angle sensor or a gyroscope or any other suitable sensor for direct or indirect measurement of the door leaf angular position. The door leaf angular position is used for the control unit to limit the safety zone area.

According to some embodiments, the control unit is configured to reduce the size/area of the initial safety zone with area of the safety zone that is not in front of a first side of the swing door leaf at the current swing path position of the swing door leaf.

According to some embodiments, the control unit is configured to stop movement of the swing door leaf if an object is identified by the first sensor in a safety zone in front of the first side of the swing door leaf. To stop the swing door leaf movement when an object is detected in the safety zone is a safe way to avoid impact between the swing door leaf and the detected object.

According to some embodiments, the first sensor is adapted to measure distance to a detected object, and the reaction of the control unit upon detecting an object in the safety zone depends on a detected distance to the object. This may be used by the operator to slow down the movement of the swing door leaf if the distance to a detected object in the safety zone is above a predetermined threshold, and stop the movement if the distance to a detected object in the safety zone is below the predetermined threshold. The speed of the movement of the swing door leaf can e.g. be adjusted as a function of the detected distance so that the door will slow down and stop before impact with the detected object in a smooth way. If the detected object moves out from the safety zone after the swing door leaf has started to slow down, it may then speed up the closing movement again. This saves energy used to run the swing door operator as a detected object that is only temporary in the safety zone and at a distance from the door will only slow down the movement temporary.

According to some embodiments, the swing door operator comprises a second sensor configured to identify objects in front of a second side of the swing door leaf, wherein the control unit is configured to react if an object is identified by the second sensor in a second safety zone in front of the second side of the swing door leaf, the control unit is configured to adapt the size/area of the second safety zone based on the swing path of the swing door leaf and the position of the swing door leaf. Object can thus be detected also in the swing path of the swing door leaf when opening the door from a closed position to an open position.

According to some embodiments, the swing door operator comprises a memory and communication means, wherein the control unit is configured to set the maximum size of the safety zone and/or the second safety zone based on limitation information stored on the memory and wherein the limitation information may be changed via external connection to the communication means.

In that case different instructions to the control unit of the swing door operator can be given for different situations. E.g. if a fire alarm is set off, the second safety zone may be omitted to make sure that door will open. If a temporary obstacle, e.g. a vase is placed in the normal second safety zone, the open end position of the swing door leaf may be changed.

According to some embodiments, the swing door leaf may be manually opened also when the swing door operator has stopped the movement of the swing door leaf so as to make sure that the swing door operator can never trap a person in a room.

According to some embodiments, the swing door leaf is a door for small rooms or narrow compartments as e.g. a public toilet.

According to some embodiments, the first sensor, second sensor and/or the position sensor is at least one built-in sensor of the motor.

According to some embodiments, the control unit is configured to initiate/activate and perform autonomous operation of the door operator in cooperation with the sensor. When an open door e.g. detects via the first sensor a person going through the door, the closing of the swing door leaf may be initiated automatically.

According to some embodiments, the motor is an electric motor, which is convenient as electric motors may be small, strong and reliable.

According to a second aspect there is provided a swing door comprising a swing door operator according to the first aspect.

According to a third aspect there is provided a room with a swing door according to the second aspect, wherein the swing door is arranged to open in an outward direction.

Effects and features of the second and third aspects are to a large extent analogous to those described above in connection with the first aspect. Embodiments mentioned in relation to the first aspect are largely compatible with the the second and third aspects.

A further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given below. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only. Various changes and modifications within the scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description.

Integrated circuits (IC) with image sensors are used in a wide range of modern day electronic devices, such as cameras and cell phones, for example. Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices have become popular IC image sensors. Compared to charge-coupled devices (CCD), CMOS image sensors are increasingly favored due to low power consumption, small size, fast data processing, a direct output of data, and low manufacturing cost.

11876723	"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for transmitting and receiving a packet in a communication system.

BACKGROUND ART

In a communication system, data congestion has become more serious due to variety of contents and an increase in high capacity contents such as High Definition (HD) contents and Ultra High Definition (UHD) contents. Further, due to the data congestion, contents which a sender, for example, host A transmits is not normally transferred to a receiver, for example, host B, and some of the contents are lost on route.

In general, since data is transmitted in the unit of packets, the loss of contents is generated in the unit of packets. The packet includes a block of data to be transmitted, address information, and management information. The data block may be, for example, a payload, the address information may be a source address or a destination address, and the management information may be, for example, a header.

Accordingly, when the packet loss is generated in the network, the receiver cannot receive the lost packet, and thus cannot know a data block and management information within the lost packet. Therefore, it causes deterioration of audio quality, degradation of video image quality or an image breaking, an omission of a subtitle, a loss of a file and the like making an inconvenience for a user.

In order to prevent the packet loss, a method of artificially dropping and transmitting data that does not have a large influence on reproduction of contents from the packet to be transmitted is used as a method of reducing loads of the network. The data that does not have a large influence on the reproduction of the contents may be, for example, a B-frame. However, such a method also cannot remove the packet loss in the network, so that Application Layer-Forward Error Correction (AL-FEC) is required as a method of restoring the packet loss generated in the network even in transmission through the packet drop. Further, a method of configuring an FEC packet and transmitting/receiving the FEC packet is required.

SUMMARY

Technical Problem

The present invention provides a method and an apparatus for transmitting/receiving a packet in a communication system.

Further, the present invention provides a method and an apparatus for transmitting/receiving an FEC packet in a communication system.

Technical Solution

A method of transmitting a packet in a communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: generating drop information indicating the existence or non-existence of a drop of each of at least one source packet to be dropped and remaining source packets except for the at least one source packet among source packets to be transmitted; generating a repair packet including repair data for reconstructing the drop information and a repair symbol for reconstructing the remaining source packets except for the at least one source packet by performing Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoding on the drop information and the remaining source packets except for the at least one source packet; and transmitting the remaining source packets except for the at least one source packet and the repair packet.

A method of receiving a packet in a communication system according to another embodiment of the present invention includes: receiving source packets and a repair packet generated by performing Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoding on the source packets; acquiring repair data for reconstructing drop information indicating the existence or non-existence of a drop of each of the source packets and a repair symbol for reconstructing the source packets from the repair packet; reconstructing the drop information based on the repair data and recognizing a source packet which a transmission device dropped from the reconstructed drop information; and reconstructing a source packet lost during transmission based on the repair symbol.

An apparatus for transmitting a packet in a communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: a drop information generator that generates drop information indicating the existence or non-existence of a drop of each of at least one source packet to be dropped among source packets to be transmitted and source packets before the drop; an encoder that generates a repair packet including repair data for reconstructing the drop information and a repair symbol for reconstructing the remaining source packets except for the at least one source packet by performing Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoding on the drop information and the remaining source packets except for the at least one source packet; and a transmitter that transmits the remaining source packets except for the at least one source packet and the repair packet.

An apparatus for receiving a packet in a communication system according to another embodiment of the present invention includes: a receiver that receives source packets, drop information indicating the existence or non-existence of a drop of each of the source packets, and a repair packet generated by performing Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoding on the source packets; and a decoder that acquires repair data for reconstructing drop information from the repair packet and a repair symbol for reconstructing the source packets from the repair packet, reconstructing the drop information based on the repair data and recognizing a source packet which a transmission device dropped from the reconstructed drop information, and reconstructing a source packet lost during transmission based on the repair symbol.

The present application claims the benefit of and priority to GB 1803549.3, filed on 6 Mar. 2018 (6 Mar. 2018), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a system for use in automated chemical or biological synthesis, for example for the validation of syntheses, assessing reproducibility using a chemical-digital-code, and discovery of new molecules and methods. Also provided are methods for preparing chemical or biological products by cooperative methods utilising the system of the invention.

BACKGROUND

The digitisation of everyday life through the computer and internet revolution has led to systems that allow error-correction, distributed ‘multi-core’ working, and gamification of task-based work (see, for example Perkel; Pronk et al.; Schrope; and Sorensen). Thus digitization has led to an explosion in cooperativity driven by common standards and protocols which means that tasks centrally managed can be distributed over many sites, yet this approach has yet to impact the field of chemistry (see Sorensen; Skilton, R. A. et al.).

However, the automation of chemical reactions has been an expanding field in the last decade including flow chemistry, peptide and nucleic acid synthesis (Machida et al.). These robotic systems are specialised and expensive ($50-500K) so the adoption of such automation in chemistry has been limited. This is because using robots to do chemistry is hard due to the bespoke nature of many chemical operations reactions resulting from a lack of standards (Ingham et al.; Li et al.).

WO 2013/175240 describes an automated procedure for exploring a chemical space. Here, a flow system is used to generate a range of products from a series of chemical and physical and inputs. A genetic algorithm controls the operation of the system by selecting future chemical and physical inputs based on the analysis of the products produced, and their ranking against a set fitness function, which is a desirable property to be obtained in the exploration of the chemical space. The flow system operates in isolation and a satisfactory exploration of the available chemical space is achieved only by the serial operation of the flow system.

There is a need therefore for systems and processes to explore chemical and biological reaction spaces in a timely and efficient manner.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a cooperative system for use in automated chemical or biological synthesis, for example for the discovery of new chemical and biological entities.

In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a system comprising a plurality of synthesisers that are in communication via a communal reporting platform.

A synthesiser is programmed for the automated synthesis of one or more chemical or biological reactions, and the synthesiser comprises a reaction vessel which is supplied by a reagent delivery system, an analytical system for analysing a reaction, and a controller for managing the reagent delivery system and the analytical system, and for communication with the reporting platform, which also includes feedback control.

A synthesiser is an automated reaction system for use in chemical and biological synthesis, with the synthesiser comprising a reaction vessel for chemical or biological reactions and an analytical system for analysis of a reaction mixture or components from the reaction mixture, including a reaction product. The synthesiser may be provided with a purification system for the at least partial purification of a reaction mixture.

Each synthesiser is provided with a controller, which is responsible for the operation of the synthesiser, and it coordinates the reagent delivery system, the reaction of those reagents within the reaction vessel and the analysis of the reaction products.

The automated synthesiser may be referred to as a chemical robot, owing to its autonomous ability to select reagents for use in the preparation of reaction products, and its ability to analyse those products and provide a report of the synthesis. The system also has the ability to select future reactions for performance, through suitable programming of the synthesiser or the reporting platform, with which the synthesiser is in communication.

The reporting platform may be a server that is accessible to all synthesisers in the system. The synthesisers are able to report to the platform and receive information from the platform. In this way, the system allows individual synthesisers to cooperate within the greater system by providing a mechanism to share synthesis information between all participants. In this way, a reaction space may be explored rapidly and without significant overlap or repetition in the work of the synthesisers.

In another use of the system, individual synthesisers within the system may be suitably programmed to repeat the work of one or more other synthesisers, thereby to provide an independent validation of the earlier work. Thus the system uses cooperativity to verify reaction results, thereby providing an assurance of a reaction outcome and its association with a particular set of reaction conditions.

The reporting platform receives information from a synthesiser and combines that information with information received from all other synthesisers in the system to give an overview of the results from all of the synthetic processes undertaken by the synthesisers. Each synthesiser is able to access the combined information forming the overview. A synthesiser having this information is then able to select a future synthesis method having knowledge of the synthesis methods performed by other synthesisers in the system.

Each synthesiser is capable of reporting as least two types of information to the reporting platform. The first is information regarding an intended synthesis to be undertaken by the synthesiser. The second is information regarding the results of a synthesis undertaken by the synthesiser.

The reporting platform may be an open-use platform for posting information to and for receiving information from. The reporting platform may be an open-use platform having private or public reporting functions. Thus, details of reactions, including planned reactions and reaction results, may be shared only with approved users, such as approved synthesisers, in a private group, or the details may be made publically available to all.

The reporting platform may be a platform where only approved users have access to reported reaction details.

The present invention also provides a method of performing a plurality or reactions, the method comprising the steps of:(i) providing a system according to the first aspect of the invention, where the system comprises a plurality of synthesisers that are in communication via a communal reporting platform;(ii) permitting each synthesiser to select a reaction for performance, and allowing each synthesiser to post its intended reaction to the reporting platform;(iii) allowing each synthesiser to perform the reaction and to post a reaction result to the reporting platform;(iv) allowing each synthesiser to observe the combined reaction results posted on the reporting platform; and(v) permitting each synthesiser to select a future reaction for performance, where that future reaction optionally differs from the reactions previously reported by all synthesisers to the reporting platform.

Preferably, each reaction undertaken by a synthesiser is unique, and has not previously been undertaken by a synthesiser in the system.

Step (vi), which follows step (v), comprises each synthesiser to post its intended reaction to the reporting platform, and then performing the selected future reaction. Following the completion of the reaction, step (iii) may be repeated optionally also together with steps (iv), (v) and (vi). These steps may be repeated as required to allow the system to undertake the desired number of reactions, such as might be needed to occupy the available chemical space.

A reaction may be unique if, for example, it differs in one or more of an identity of a reagent, catalyst or solvent, or differs in one or more of an amount of a reagent, catalyst or solvent or in a reaction condition, such as temperature or light exposure.

The products of each reaction may be the same or different. Where they are the same, the system may be use to explore the reaction conditions for the preparation of that product.

These and other aspects and embodiments are described in further detail herein.

Even in those instances in which the user is immediately aware that the mobile device is no longer in their possession, enough time can lapse between when the user becomes aware of such and when the user is able to deactivate or otherwise shut down the mobile communication device that a wrongful possessor can easily gain access to the personal data stored thereon.

Therefore, a need exists to develop systems, methods and the like for ensuring that a mobile device is either shutdown or locked and/or personal data stored therein is made inaccessible in response to the mobile device being determined to be out of the possession of the user. Specifically, a need exists to shut down, lock or otherwise make personal data inaccessible on mobile communication device, regardless of whether the user is aware that the mobile communication device is out of their possession.

FIELD

The present invention relates to a near-site robotic construction system and method, in particular to a near-site robotic construction system and method that transfers a building information modelling design into an actual robotic prefabrication task that is planned, scheduled, simulated and proven with the constructability by a computer-assisted cloud based platform operated by a user to actually prefabricate basic construction components at a near-site position that is in a close proximity to a construction base.

BACKGROUND

In the field of civil engineering, the building construction process for building private properties, such as houses, homes, and offices, and public structures, such as bridges, highways, and hospitals, has an ancient heritage. Through the centuries of development, currently there are several major construction methods available. The first-type construction method is the on-site construction method, which means that everything, including construction components and building, is built on the construction site. Although the on-site construction method has been widely accepted and commonly used throughout the world for centuries, it has many defects including being very costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, low productivity, etc.

Therefore, the second-type construction method, which is classified as the off-site construction method, is emerging and being reduced to practice. Modular homes and precast concrete are the most commonly used off-site construction methods. The precast concrete method is applied to the construction of public infrastructure. Almost all of the large pieces of required basic components, such as reinforced concrete walls, and columns, are pre-casted by pre-casting concrete in a reusable mold by using large-scale equipment installed in a pre-casting factory, which is usually far away from the construction site. The pre-made components are transported to the construction site by heavyweight vehicles. Usually the off-site method is considered to be able to improve the overall efficiency by an average of 20% to 25% in all aspects of construction cost, speed, and labor demands.

The third-type construction method is the robotics off-site construction and classified as the off-site construction method as well. The programmed sophisticated industrial robots replace large-scale facilities to be installed in a professional off-site factory, to prefabricate and assemble construction components. Averagely, the off-site robotics construction method further reduces overall construction cost and increase productivity, as compared to the pre-casting method.

However, for the off-site construction methods, certain obvious defects are raised. For instances, the standardized production lines reduce the versatility of building designs, and the logistics and shipping costs become significant and dominant. In particular, the off-site robotics construction method, a huge investment is needed to train engineers, contractors, and users to control and program the robots or robot arms. Users also need to spend lots of time on looping the processes of continuous testing, re-planning, re-designing, etc. In addition, the conventional robotic and automation field is used to focus on solutions for general purpose solutions or construction robotics for specific tasks.

Hence, there is a need to solve the above deficiencies/issues.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to a technology for simplifying login processing in a control system which comprises a plurality of units.

BACKGROUND ART

At production sites and the like using factory automation (FA), a control unit such as a programmable logic controller (PLC) is used for controlling various facilities and various devices disposed in each facility. Recently, a control unit which can be connected to an external device has come into wide use. Regarding such a control unit, Patent Literature 1 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2016-194808) discloses a PLC which can access a database of an external device.

Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2016-194808

SUMMARY OF INVENTION

Technical Problem

Various functional units can be connected to a control unit. Diverse applications can be installed in each functional unit. As necessary, a user can add a functional unit.

In order to ensure security, every time a user accesses a different functional unit, each functional unit requires an input of an account of a user. It would be troublesome for a user if an input of an account were required every time he/she accesses a different functional unit. In addition, if there are a number of accounts to be managed, a user may repeatedly use the same account or set a simple password therefor. For this reason, on the contrary, there is a probability that a security level will be degraded. Therefore, a technology for centrally managing user accounts in a control system which comprises a plurality of units is desired.

Solution to Problem

An example of the present disclosure provides a control system which comprises a plurality of units. The plurality of units includes a first unit, and a second unit which is able to communicate with the first unit. The first unit requests an input of a user account to an external device constituted to be able to communicate with the first unit upon reception of a request for access to the first unit from the external device and transmits the user account to the second unit upon reception of the user account from the external device. The second unit refers to registration information defining account information of registered users, determines whether or not the user account received by the second unit has been registered, and transmits a token indicating permission of access to the first unit when it is determined that the user account received by the second unit has been registered. The first unit transmits the token received from the second unit to the external device.

According to the present disclosure, it is no longer necessary for a user to perform login processing for each of the units constituting the control system. In addition, since the number of user accounts to be managed by a user can be reduced, troublesomeness in management of user accounts can be eliminated. As a result, a probability of leakage of user accounts to the outside is reduced, and thus the security level of the control system is improved.

In the example of the present disclosure, the plurality of units further includes a third unit. The third unit permits access to the third unit when the token is received from the external device together with a request for access to the third unit.

According to the present disclosure, in the control system, a token issued for the first unit can also be diverted for the third unit. Accordingly, it is no longer necessary for a user to perform login processing for each of the units constituting the control system.

In the example of the present disclosure, the third unit is constituted to be able to communicate with the first unit. The first unit relays communication between the second unit and the external device and relays communication between the third unit and the external device.

According to the present disclosure, since the first unit relays communication between the second and third units and the external device, each of the units inside a control system2can be concealed from the outside. Accordingly, direct communication between each of the units inside the control system2and the external device is prevented, and thus a risk of security accompanying communication is reduced.

In the example of the present disclosure, an access authority is associated with each user account defined in the account information. The second unit refers to the account information upon reception of the user account from the external device, identifies the access authority associated with the user account, and further transmits the identified access authority to the first unit when the token is transmitted to the first unit. The first unit transmits information according to the access authority received from the second unit to the external device.

According to the present disclosure, in the control system, information provided to a user can be changed in accordance with the access authority applied to the user. Accordingly, in the control system, appropriate information according to the access authority can be provided to a user.

In the example of the present disclosure, an operation mode of the control system includes a maintenance mode indicating that the control system is under maintenance. The first unit or the second unit rewrites the access authority of a kind set in advance as an access authority of another kind set in advance when the operation mode of the control system is the maintenance mode.

According to the present disclosure, in the control system, when the operation mode of the control system is the maintenance mode, the access authority can be suitably switched. Accordingly, in the control system, appropriate information according to the access authority applied at the time of being in the maintenance mode can be provided to a user.

In the example of the present disclosure, the first unit or the second unit restores the access authority which has been rewritten as an access authority of another kind set in advance to the access authority before being rewritten when a condition which is set in advance and indicates that maintenance of the control system has ended is satisfied.

According to the present disclosure, in the control system, when maintenance ends, a rewritten access authority can be automatically restored.

Another example of the present disclosure provides a control method for a control system which comprises a plurality of units. The plurality of units includes a first unit, and a second unit which is able to communicate with the first unit. The control method includes a step of the first unit requesting an input of a user account to an external device constituted to be able to communicate with the first unit upon reception of a request for access to the first unit from the external device and transmitting the user account to the second unit upon reception of the user account from the external device; a step of the second unit referring to registration information defining account information of registered users, determining whether or not the user account received by the second unit has been registered, and transmitting a token indicating permission of access to the first unit when it is determined that the user account received by the second unit has been registered; and a step of the first unit transmitting the token received from the second unit to the external device.

According to the present disclosure, it is no longer necessary for a user to perform login processing for each of the units constituting the control system. In addition, since the number of user accounts to be managed by a user can be reduced, troublesomeness in management of user accounts can be eliminated. As a result, a probability of leakage of user accounts to the outside is reduced, and thus the security level of the control system is improved.

11997569	"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to the field of communications technologies, and in particular, to a method and a system for transmitting an uplink signal between a plurality of carriers, user equipment, and a base station.

BACKGROUND

In a Long Term Evolution (English full name: Long Term Evolution, LTE for short) system, channel estimation is required. Channel estimation is a process of estimating a model parameter of an assumed channel model when receiving data.

Currently, for a carrier that supports both uplink transmission and downlink transmission, it is beneficial to perform channel estimation by using sounding reference information (English full name: Sounding Reference Signal, SRS for short) and channel reciprocity.

However, user equipment (English full name: User Equipment, UE for short) generally can aggregate a larger quantity of downlink carriers than a quantity of uplink carriers. As a result, when uplink transmission resources are in shortage, some downlink carriers with downlink transmission cannot be used for uplink transmission, for example, transmission of an uplink SRS signal. Obviously, for these downlink carriers, channel reciprocity cannot be effectively utilized.

SUMMARY

Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and a system for transmitting an uplink signal between a plurality of carriers, user equipment, and a base station, so that channel reciprocity can be effectively utilized.

In view of this, a first aspect of the present invention provides a method for transmitting an uplink signal between a plurality of carriers, including:

The method for transmitting an uplink signal between a plurality of carriers means that a downlink subframe of a frequency division duplex (English full name: Frequency Division Duplex, FDD for short) or time division duplex (English full name: Time Division Duplex, TDD for short) carrier may be converted to a subframe in a specific subframe format, and may be used for uplink channel detection or channel state information reporting. The converted-to downlink subframe includes at least one uplink signal. Alternatively, an uplink subframe of the FDD or TDD carrier is converted to a subframe that includes transmission of at least one uplink signal.

Alternatively, a special subframe of the FDD or TDD carrier is converted to a subframe that includes transmission of at least one uplink signal. Therefore, the method includes:receiving indication signaling sent by a base station; andtransmitting an uplink signal in a target subframe of a corresponding target carrier based on the indication signaling.

Optionally, uplink signals may be specific to some UEs that have an uplink signal transmission requirement.

A beneficial effect is: The uplink signal is transmitted in the target subframe of the target carrier based on the received indication signaling. Apparently, when the target carrier performs downlink transmission, for a larger quantity of carriers in downlink transmission, the indication signaling is used to enable a downlink subframe or an uplink subframe of the carrier to transmit the uplink signal. Apparently, in the present invention, channel reciprocity is effectively utilized.

12083706	"BACKGROUND

Technical Field

This disclosure generally relates to aggregate particles, and is particularly, but not exclusively, applicable to cementitious compositions for use in the building industry or related industries.

Description of the Related Art

Cementitious building and paving products are well known and are commonly made up of aggregate material and a cementitious or similar type binder and may include such articles as bricks, concrete, paving stones, roofing tiles, blocks, decorative articles, and the like. An undesirable feature which may be associated with such cementitious products is their high density.

Lightweight aggregates are important engineering materials. Together with cement and water, they are used to prepare lightweight aggregate concrete. Lightweight aggregate concrete is a relatively low density material that is finding increasing use in building construction. Lightweight aggregates confer significant engineering benefits.

Lightweight aggregates currently available include manufactured materials such as sintered fly-ash, expanded clay, expanded shale, and foamed slag, as well as naturally occurring geological materials such as scoria and pumice. Such known lightweight aggregates and methods of making and utilizing the same may suffer from a variety of deficiencies or drawbacks. Accordingly, applicant believes improved aggregates and methods of making and utilizing the same are desirable.

Furthermore, only a small percentage of the plastics materials that are set aside for recycling are in fact recycled due to the time and cost of sorting the plastics into their differing types and washing the plastic before each type of plastic can be processed further. As a result, a large percentage of such plastic materials may be placed in landfills or leaked into the environment.

Plastics are one of the fastest growing municipal solid waste components, and there is increasing public demand for recycling. However, plastics are exceedingly difficult to recycle efficiently with available technology. For example, much of the plastic material in municipal wastes is multi-layered, heavily pigmented, contaminated and difficult to sort. The need to separate the various plastic types makes recycling of plastics technically difficult and expensive. Traditional recycling is therefore capable of dealing with just a small portion of the total volume of waste plastic generated by society. Accordingly, applicant believes improved methods and processes of repurposing mixed plastic waste are desirable.

BRIEF SUMMARY

Embodiments described herein provide a lightweight aggregate made in part of mixed plastic waste material, including “tragic” plastic, namely those plastics that have zero value from a traditional recycling perspective. Advantageously, the aggregate may enable the production of lightweight construction products, such as lightweight construction blocks, while simultaneously removing waste plastics from the waste stream, which may otherwise end up in landfills or littering the environment. Such aggregate may be referred to herein as preconditioned absorptive resin aggregate, or PARA™ for short. Such aggregate may also be referred to as preconditioned resin aggregate, or PRA™, for short. Advantageously, embodiments provide for converting commingled plastic waste that has little to no current value into an environmentally and visually benign aggregate that can have multiple applications as a safe and inert, easily transportable, feedstock for multiple applications in various industry sectors, such as, for example, construction, agricultural, road building, and waste to fuel applications. Other embodiments described herein provide a mixed waste plastic feedstock form forming such aggregate.

As an example, one embodiment of a method of making a lightweight aggregate may be summarized as including: obtaining a supply of granulated mixed plastic waste treated with a preconditioning agent comprising, consisting or consisting essentially of calcium oxide (quicklime or burnt lime) and/or calcium hydroxide (slaked lime); mixing the supply of granulated mixed plastic waste treated with the preconditioning agent with one or more additives to form a plastic waste mixture, the one or more additives comprising pozzolans; hot extruding the plastic waste mixture to form an extruded product comprising waste plastic material; cooling the extruded product; and then processing the extruded product to form an aggregate in which the waste plastic material is exposed at exterior surfaces of the aggregate.

The supply of granulated mixed plastic waste may include a variety of plastic materials including high density polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, ABS, polyurethane, polyamide, and/or PET. The supply of granulated mixed plastic waste may further comprise non-plastic material in the form of food residue, cellulosic material and/or metallic foil material, for example. In some instances, the supply of granulated mixed plastic waste may be characterized by waste plastic having a granule size less than a predetermined maximum granule size obtained by shredding and/or pulverizing mixed plastic waste products.

FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention relates to the detection and quantification of nucleic acid. In particular, the present invention relates to the detection and quantification of RNA.

BACKGROUND

Circulating biomarkers are promising tools used for cancer detection, prognostication and prediction of cancer treatment response. These circulating biomarkers typically include DNA samples such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating-tumor cells. It is known that various RNA molecules are also potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases such as cancer and are useful for early cancer diagnosis, tumor progression monitor, and prediction of therapy response. It is also known that cancer cells release cell-free RNA (cfRNA) into the body circulation. These cancer-associated cfRNA, also known as circulating-tumor RNA (ctRNA) can be found in the serum and blood plasma of cancer patients. While both cfDNA and cfRNA are promising cancer biomarkers, the measurement of cfDNA is traditionally preferred due to its stability in biological fluids. Despite the discovery of RNA in blood plasma and serum over 20 years ago, there is still a general perception that extracellular RNA in blood is extremely unstable and highly fragmented, given the relative instability of RNA compared to DNA, which in itself is unstable when fragmented in the blood, due to the presence of a high concentration of ribonucleases in the blood circulation. Multiple studies have documented the presence of tumor-specific circulating RNA (ctRNA) in serum and plasma in cancer patients. Current non-oncology clinical applications of cfRNA include the measurement of maternal and fetal cfRNA transcripts to monitor longitudinal phenotypic changes in both the mother and the fetus and to assess fetal gestational age. It is known that in blood circulation, cfRNA occur in free form, bound to proteins or lipids, or as exosomes protected in various types of membrane-derived microvesicles, making them highly stable. It is plausible that plasma cfRNA is a mixture of RNA protected by RNA binding proteins and RNA contained within extracellular vesicles. The wide availability of cfRNA in plasma, serum and many other bodily fluids and their paradoxical stability makes them potential candidates for the development of biomarkers for rapid, sensitive and inexpensive diagnostics. Furthermore, detection of ctRNA provides the same mutational information as ctDNA, but additionally, it can also provide quantitative information about the expression levels of target genes of interest, and can potentially increase the sensitivity of detection of variants with low allelic frequencies due to the overexpression of tumor-specific transcripts. Lastly, the expression of various ctRNA species is dysregulated due to uncontrolled cell proliferation, rendering it a potential valuable tool for cancer detection. At present, the most common technique for detection of cfRNA is using quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). However, methods involving qRT-PCR are often limited by their sensitivity when assaying low input samples. NGS may be more well-suited due the ability to detect novel cfRNAs and differentiate RNA isoforms. With hybridization-based library preparation methods, sequence-specific biases due to enzymatic ligation during library construction step leads to biased representation of transcripts, particularly during analysis of small RNA. Targeted NGS assays such as hybridization capture or amplicon sequencing may also allow for sensitive quantification of cfRNAs (as opposed to whole transcriptome analysis with low conversion efficiency).

Many cancer genes exhibit genomic alterations, and these genomic alteration events have been discovered in a wide variety of tumors. Targeted DNA-based next generation sequencing techniques specifically designed to detect rearrangements in kinases can effectively detect oncogenic kinase fusions with high confidence. However, there are technical limitations to the ability of such DNA-based assays to detect certain genomic alterations, such as gene fusions. DNA-based assays can only identify fusions in genes where the genomic rearrangements occur in typically short introns effectively covered in the panel. Some clinically important fusions arise from rearrangements in very long introns, the complete coverage of which would significantly compromise coverage of the remainder of the genes on the panel. Hence, there are gaps in the coverage of certain introns resulting in blind spots in the detection of potential rearrangement breakpoint. Fusion detection using DNA does not provide direct evidence that the rearrangement produces a fusion expressed at the mRNA level, a particular problem for rearrangements that appear non-canonical at the genomic DNA level. In fact, in one study in lung cancer tissue samples, it was shown that by using RNA sequencing, alterations were detected in 14% (36/254) cases which were otherwise negative for clinically actionable mutations by DNA sequencing. For example, gene fusion events involving Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (NTRK) gene (NTRK1/2/3) and neuregulin-1 (NRG1) gene cannot be effectively covered in a targeted DNA sequencing panel without compromising on the cost of sequencing and the coverage of the remaining genes in the sequencing panel.

Apart from detecting genomic alterations events, the ability to accurately quantify genomic expression of relevant cancer biomarkers non-invasively is important for predicting the response to cancer therapies and making the appropriate treatment decision. For example, the gene expression level of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a predictive cancer biomarker used to identify cancer patients with a greater likelihood of responding to immunotherapy. PD-L1 is also a potential predictive biomarker to measure the sensitivity of tumors to immune checkpoint blockade drug inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab and nivolumab), anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, (ipilimumab and tremelimumab) and anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) (atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab). Other genetic biomarkers that are useful for predicting the likelihood of responding to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy include T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), Lymphocyte Activating 3 (LAG-3) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). The ability to quantify the expression of these target biomarkers longitudinally and non-invasively can be very useful for monitoring treatment response and making treatment decisions.

Conventional assays routinely detect for genomic alterations at the DNA level, limiting the scope of detection to DNA genomic alterations such as mutations and quantifying genomic copy number changes.

Thus, there is a need to provide a method for sensitive detection and quantification of genomic alteration events and expression of genes associated with disease (such as cancer) that overcomes, or at least ameliorates, one or more of the disadvantages described above. There is a need to provide a method to simultaneously detect genomic alterations such as structural rearrangements, and gene expression using an alternative sample input such as RNA (such as circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA)).

It is often desirable to detect flow of power to a circuit such as in an on-chip power to reduce or prevent interface leakage in a dual power system. For example, a power detector can be configured to detect the voltage level of an input power. When the voltage level is higher than a certain threshold, the power detector outputs a specific logic state to indicate that the power is on. When the voltage is lower than a certain threshold, the power detector outputs another logic state to indicate that the power is off.

The name of the text file containing the Sequence Listing is “170813_Seqlisting.txt”, which was created on Dec. 10, 2019 and is 147,297 bytes in size. The subject matter of the Sequence Listing is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a nucleic acid construct comprising a promoter sequence of an operon comprising a secA gene or a functional fragment or functional variant thereof, which is suitable for driving expression of heterologous polynucleotides. Moreover, the present invention relates to an expression vector and a host cell comprising said nucleic acid construct and methods for expressing polynucleotides using the promoter sequence.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Microorganisms are nowadays widely applied in industry by making use of their fermentation capacity. Microorganisms are particularly used as a host for fermentative production of a variety of substances such as enzymes, proteins, chemicals, sugars and polymers. For these purposes, microorganisms are subject of genetic engineering in order to adapt their gene expression to the demands of the specific production process.

A key element to drive gene expression in a host cell is the promoter sequence. For gene expression to take place, the RNA polymerase must attach to the promoter sequence near a gene. Thus, promoters contain specific DNA sequences that provide a binding site for RNA polymerase and also for other proteins that recruit RNA polymerase to the recognition sequence (i.e., transcription factors). In bacteria, the promoter is usually recognized by the RNA polymerase and an associated sigma factor, which are guided to the promoter DNA by an activator protein's binding to its own DNA binding site nearby. In eukaryotes, the process is more complicated, and various factors are necessary for the binding of an RNA polymerase to the promoter. Influenced by the nucleic acid sequence, promoters can confer low, moderate or high expression levels and can be constitutive or inducible.

Due to their central role in gene expression, there is a constant need for novel sequences that are suitable as a promoter for the expression of transgenes in a host cell under specific conditions.

In particular, for transgene products, which are not tolerated by the host cell in high amounts, promoter sequences that provide a moderate expression level are needed. Examples of such transgene products are components of the restriction modification system, like restriction endonucleases and methyltransferases, recombinases, and proteins conferring antibiotic resistance.

The present inventors have found that using a secA promoter for the expression of a transgene in a host cell greatly improves expression results, in particular if moderate expression levels of the transgene are desired.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a particular type of promoter sequences and nucleic acid constructs comprising such promoter sequences.

Specifically, the present invention is directed to a nucleic acid construct comprising a polynucleotide operably linked to one or more control sequence that directs the expression of the polynucleotide in a host cell, wherein at least one control sequence comprises a promoter sequence of an operon comprising a secA gene or a functional fragment or functional variant of the promoter sequence and wherein said promoter sequence is heterologous to the polynucleotide.

In one embodiment, the promoter sequence comprises the consensus sequence TKNTTTGGAAATN(8-12)RTRTGNTAWRATAWN(4-6)(SEQ ID NO: 117) immediately followed by a transcription start site.

In another embodiment, the promoter sequence comprises the consensus sequence TCAWTMNTGCTGYN(11-13)TTAATGRTAADATTYDTN(4-5)(SEQ ID NO: 118) immediately followed by a transcription start site.

In a further embodiment, the invention is directed to an expression vector and a host cell comprising the nucleic acid construct comprising the promoter sequence described herein.

Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of expressing a polynucleotide, comprising the steps of (a) providing a host cell comprising a heterologous nucleic acid construct comprising a promoter as described herein; (b) cultivating the recombinant host cell of step (a) under conditions conductive for the expression of the polynucleotide; and (c) optionally, recovering a protein of interest encoded by the polynucleotide.

The promoter sequence described herein is particularly useful for the expression of polynucleotides which require a moderate expression level in a host cell.

Technical Field

This disclosure relates to electromagnetic navigation systems and methods and more particularly to methods and systems for correcting magnetic interference caused by metal objects within the clinical space.

Discussion of Related Art

Electromagnetic navigation (EMN) has helped expand medical imaging, diagnosis, and treatment capabilities by enabling a location and/or an orientation of a medical device to be accurately determined while the device is within the body of a patient. One example of a medical procedure in which EMN is employed is ELECTROMAGNETIC NAVIGATION BRONCHOSCOPY® (ENB™), which includes a planning phase and a navigation phase. During the planning phase, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest of the patient is used to generate a virtual three-dimensional bronchial map of the patient and a planned pathway for the navigation phase. During the navigation phase, an antenna assembly radiates electromagnetic fields throughout the chest of the patient, a practitioner places electromagnetic sensors on the chest of the patient and inserts a device, e.g., a catheter, having an electromagnetic sensor into the airway of the patient, and a computing device determines a location and/or an orientation (e.g., relative to the planned pathway) of the electromagnetic sensor based on the electromagnetic fields sensed by the electromagnetic sensors.

To enable accurate determination of sensor location and/or orientation, a detailed map of electromagnetic (EM) field measurements at respective sensor locations is generated. Generating such a map, however, requires taking precise electromagnetic field measurements at many (for example, hundreds of thousands or more) locations within the expected electromagnetic volume, which is a laborious and time-consuming process that, in some cases, requires expensive machines. Also, interfering EM fields may be detected by the EM sensors and, as a result, the accuracy of the detected position and orientation of an EM sensor within the EM field suffers.

1. Field of the Disclosure

The present disclosure is generally directed to an air deflector that facilitates tubeless tire seating during inflation.

2. Description of Related Art

A traditional bicycle wheel may include a rim formed of extruded metals or other materials that are bent and bonded into a circular shape having consistently shaped cross sections. Recently, other materials, such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics, have been used in the manufacture of bicycle rims, which may be formed into circular shapes through non-extrusion based processes. Carbon fiber reinforced plastics may, for example, be used.

The rim may be configured for the attachment of any number of different types of tires. For example, the rim may be configured for attachment of a tubeless clincher tire. The tubeless clincher tire includes beads that interact with a tire engaging portion of the rim. The tire engaging portion of the rim includes a rim bed that defines a well. The well provides a volume into which the beads of the tire may be placed when the tire is being attached to the rim.

The tubeless clincher tire is to be seated in bead walls that extend between hooks and the well on opposite sides of the well, respectively, to obtain a proper sealing between the tubeless clincher tire and the rim. The proper sealing prevents air leakages during and after inflation of the tubeless clincher tire.

Seating the tubeless clincher tire may require a high constant airflow input while the tire is being inflated. The most reliable way to produce the high constant airflow input may be to pump in compressed air using, for example, an air compressor. In many situations, however, a bicycle user does not have access to a compressed air source.

SUMMARY

This Patent Application is a 371 national stage of PCT Application No. PCT/CN2020/074102 filed on Jan. 31, 2020, entitled “PRECODER INDICATION IN DOWNLINK CONTROL INFORMATION,” and assigned to the assignee hereof. The disclosure of the prior Application is considered part of and is incorporated by reference into this Patent Application.

INTRODUCTION

Aspects of the present disclosure generally relate to wireless communication and to techniques and apparatuses for precoder indication.

Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various telecommunication services such as telephony, video, data, messaging, and broadcasts. Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, and/or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

A wireless communication network may include a number of base stations (BSs) that can support communication for a number of user equipment (UEs). A user equipment (UE) may communicate with a base station (BS) via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the BS to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the BS. As will be described in more detail herein, a BS may be referred to as a Node B, a gNB, an access point (AP), a radio head, a transmit receive point (TRP), a new radio (NR) BS, a 5G Node B, and/or the like.

The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different user equipment to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. New radio (NR), which may also be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). NR is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink (DL), using CP-OFDM and/or SC-FDM (e.g., also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink (UL), as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. However, as the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, there exists a need for further improvements in LTE and NR technologies. Preferably, these improvements should be applicable to other multiple access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.

11886698	"TECHNICAL FIELD

The disclosed embodiments relate generally to devices with touch-screen displays, and more particularly to scrolling lists and to translating, rotating, and scaling electronic documents on devices with touch-screen displays.

BACKGROUND

As portable electronic devices become more compact, and the number of functions performed by a given device increases, it has become a significant challenge to design a user interface that allows users to easily interact with a multifunction device. This challenge is particularly significant for handheld portable devices, which have much smaller screens than desktop or laptop computers. This situation is unfortunate because the user interface is the gateway through which users receive not only content but also responses to user actions or behaviors, including user attempts to access a device's features, tools, and functions. Some portable communication devices (e.g., mobile telephones, sometimes called mobile phones, cell phones, cellular telephones, and the like) have resorted to adding more pushbuttons, increasing the density of push buttons, overloading the functions of pushbuttons, or using complex menu systems to allow a user to access, store and manipulate data. These conventional user interfaces often result in complicated key sequences and menu hierarchies that must be memorized by the user.

Many conventional user interfaces, such as those that include physical pushbuttons, are also inflexible. This is unfortunate because it may prevent a user interface from being configured and/or adapted by either an application running on the portable device or by users. When coupled with the time consuming requirement to memorize multiple key sequences and menu hierarchies, and the difficulty in activating a desired pushbutton, such inflexibility is frustrating to most users.

As a result of the small size of display screens on portable electronic devices and the potentially large size of electronic files, frequently only a portion of a list or of an electronic document of interest to a user can be displayed on the screen at a given time. Users thus will frequently need to scroll displayed lists or to translate displayed electronic documents. Users also will need to rotate and to scale (i.e., magnify or de-magnify) displayed electronic documents. However, the limitations of conventional user interfaces can cause these actions to be awkward to perform.

Furthermore, scrolling displayed lists and translating electronic documents can be awkward on both portable and non-portable electronic devices with touch-screen displays. A user may become frustrated if the scrolling or translation does not reflect the user's intent. Similarly, a user may become frustrated if rotation and scaling of electronic documents does not reflect the user's intent.

Accordingly, there is a need for devices with touch-screen displays with more transparent and intuitive user interfaces for scrolling lists of items and for translating, rotating, and scaling electronic documents that are easy to use, configure, and/or adapt.

SUMMARY

The above deficiencies and other problems associated with user interfaces for portable devices and devices with touch-sensitive displays are reduced or eliminated by the disclosed device. In some embodiments, the device has a touch-sensitive display (also known as a “touch screen”) with a graphical user interface (GUI), one or more processors, memory and one or more modules, programs or sets of instructions stored in the memory for performing multiple functions. In some embodiments, the user interacts with the GUI primarily through finger contacts and gestures on the touch-sensitive display. In some embodiments, the functions may include telephoning, video conferencing, e-mailing, instant messaging, blogging, digital photographing, digital videoing, web browsing, digital music playing, and/or digital video playing. Instructions for performing these functions may be included in a computer program product configured for execution by one or more processors.

This application claims the benefit of the filing date of German Patent Application No. 10 2022 201 008.6 filed on 31 Jan. 2022, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to field devices for process and factory automation in industrial or private environments. In particular, the present disclosure relates to a field device with an illuminated display that can be operated.

TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

Field devices, which are configured for process and factory automation in industrial or private environments, are used to determine process parameters or to detect objects (level detection). Such field devices are, for example, level meters, pressure meters, flow meters, level sensors or microwave barriers.

Operating keys and a display for visualizing measured values or diagnostic information can be integrated in the field device for operating the field devices. Strong light irradiation or soiling can make operation and readability difficult, so that input errors can occur.

SUMMARY

With this in mind, there may be a desire to facilitate the operability of field devices.

A first aspect of the present disclosure relates to a field device that is configured for process automation in an industrial or private environment. It comprises a control element configured to operate the field device. The operating element comprises, in combination, a button, i.e., a key, and a luminous display, i.e., an illuminated indicator. The luminous display is configured for optical feedback of an operating command issued by a user to the button. The optical feedback is in particular a large-area light signal emitted by a large-area light source. In particular, the luminous display can be configured to emit optical feedback in different colors, for example red, yellow and green, or white or blue. Also, the luminous display may be arranged to emit the luminous signals permanently or in a kind of “flashing mode”, i.e., alternately “on” and “off”. Color and flashing frequency can convey valuable information to the user, and without the need to read writing on a display.

According to one embodiment, the key can be rotated and/or moved laterally. Alternatively or additionally, it can also be pressed. In this way, various operating commands issued by the user to the key can be converted into corresponding operating signals. In this way, a wide variety of operating commands can be entered by a single button, and this without the user having to read the information written on a display or the button. The optical feedback in the form of a light signal or several light signals, which can still be perceived at a rather unfavorable viewing angle, further simplifies operation. This is particularly advantageous in difficult installation conditions, lighting conditions or poor eyesight.

According to a further embodiment, the button has a capacitive or magnetic sensor system for converting an operating command issued by the user to the button into a corresponding operating signal. In particular, it may be provided that the operation of the button is contactless.

In the latter case, a field device cover can be used, which is attached to the field device housing and covers the operating element. This allows the operating element to be protected from environmental influences or hazardous areas, which may be particularly advantageous for outdoor use.

According to another embodiment, the light indicator is integrated into the key.

According to a further embodiment, the key is divided into several tactile segments, for example two, three or four segments. It may be provided that the different segments can be illuminated in different colors, which further facilitates input. Different colors can be assigned to different operating commands. For example, the color green can be used for acknowledgement, etc.

According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the operating element is designed as a removable, retrofittable module that can be plugged onto the housing of the field device. Electrical interfaces are provided for this purpose. It may also be provided that the operating element is connected by a rotary movement, for example in combination with a type of bayonet catch.

According to an embodiment, the field device has no further operating element. Rather, it can be operated and parameterized exclusively by the operating element described above.

According to another embodiment, the field device is a level sensor, in particular a level radar sensor that takes transit time measurements, a point level sensor, a flow meter, or a microwave barrier, in particular a reflective microwave barrier.

In the following, embodiments of the present disclosure are described with reference to the figures. If the same reference signs are used in the description of the figures, these designate the same or similar elements. The illustrations in the figures are schematic and not to scale.

11926711	"CROSS REFERENCE TO THE RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application is the national phase entry of International Application No. PCT/CN2019/110729, filed on Oct. 12, 2019, which is based upon and claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 201811250638.5, filed on Oct. 25, 2018, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to a thermoplastic starch (TPS)/polylactic acid (PLA)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blend modified biodegradable resin prepared by using a chain extender and a preparation method thereof, and belongs to the field of biodegradable plastics.

BACKGROUND

Starch is a commonly used biodegradable material. The native starch is subjected to esterification, grafting, and other chemical modification processes to obtain a TPS resin.

PLA is a new type of bio-based and renewable biodegradable material made from starch raw materials extracted from renewable plant resources. The starch raw material is saccharified to obtain glucose, the glucose and a certain strain are fermented to produce high-purity lactic acid, and PLA with a certain molecular weight is synthesized by chemical synthesis. The PLA has excellent biodegradability, and the used PLA can be completely degraded by microorganisms in nature under certain conditions to finally produce carbon dioxide and water, which avoids polluting the environment. The PLA is a well-recognized environmentally friendly material.

PBAT is a copolymer of butylene adipate and butylene terephthalate, which has characteristics of PBA and PBT. PBAT not only has excellent ductility and elongation at break, but also excellent heat and impact resistance. In addition, PBAT has excellent biodegradability, and is one of the degradable materials which are active in current research on biodegradable plastics and have the broadest application in the market.

TPS, PLA and PBAT are all aliphatic resins, and all are biodegradable materials. However, the TPS is poorly compatible with the PLA, and the mechanical properties of the blended resin are poor so it is basically impossible to granulate and blow a film.

SUMMARY

An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a TPS/PLA/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin prepared by using a chain extender, so as to improve the mechanical properties of resin effectively.

The objective of the present disclosure is achieved by the following technical solutions:

A TPS/PLA/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin prepared by using a chain extender is disclosed, being prepared from the following raw materials:20-30 parts by weight of TPS;20-30 parts by weight of PLA;40-60 parts by weight of PBAT; and0.5-0.9 parts by weight of a chain extender, styrene, methyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate copolymer.

The present disclosure further provides a method for preparing the above TPS/PLA/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin by using a chain extender, including the steps of:step 1, adding a chain extender into an ethyl acetate solution, and stirring until dissolved, to obtain a solution;step 2, weighing and mixing dried TPS granules and PBAT granules, feeding mixed granules into a twin-screw extrusion granulator, extruding, air-cooling, stretching, and cold-cutting to obtain TPS/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin granules; andstep 3, mixing the TPS/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin granules with PLA granules, spraying the solution obtained in step 1 on the surface of the mixed granules by a spraying method, feeding the mixed granules into the twin-screw extrusion granulator, extruding, air-cooling, stretching, and cold-cutting to obtain TPS/PLA/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin granules.

Preferably, in step 1, the chain extender may be added into one-fold mass of the ethyl acetate solution.

Preferably, in step 2, twin-screw extrusion may be conducted at a temperature of 130-165° C., a screw speed of 300 r/min, and a granulation capacity of 250 kg/h.

Preferably, in step 3, the twin-screw extrusion may be conducted at a temperature of 140-175° C., a screw speed of 260-300 r/min, and a granulation capacity of 220-250 kg/h.

The present disclosure further provides a method for making a TPS/PLA/PBAT blend modified packaging bag prepared by using a chain extender, including the steps of:step 1, adding a chain extender into an ethyl acetate solution, and stirring until dissolved, to obtain a solution;step 2, weighing and mixing dried TPS granules and PBAT granules, feeding mixed granules into a twin-screw extrusion granulator, extruding, air-cooling, stretching, and cold-cutting to obtain TPS/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin granules;step 3, mixing the TPS/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin granules with PLA granules, spraying the solution obtained in step 1 on the surface of the mixed granules by a spraying method, feeding the mixed granules into the twin-screw extrusion granulator, extruding, air-cooling, stretching, and cold-cutting to obtain TPS/PLA/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin granules;step 4, blowing the TPS/PLA/PBAT blend modified biodegradable resin granules directly into a film by a film blowing machine; andstep 5, making a film obtained in step 4 into a packaging bag by printing and bagmaking.

Preferably, in step 1, the chain extender may be added into one-fold mass of the ethyl acetate solution.

Preferably, in step 2, twin-screw extrusion may be conducted at a temperature of 130-165° C., a screw speed of 300 r/min, and a granulation capacity of 250 kg/h.

Preferably, in step 3, the twin-screw extrusion may be conducted at a temperature of 140-175° C., a screw speed of 260-300 r/min, and a granulation capacity of 220-250 kg/h.

Preferably, in step 4, film thickness may be less than 0.10 mm.

A method for adding a chain extender is adopted in the present disclosure. The chain extender added during blending may have a modifying effect on chain extension and improve material compatibility. The preparation method is a two-step method: blending the TPS with the PBAT in a twin screw for granulating; mixing TPS/PBAT mixed granules with PLA granules, and dissolving the chain extender into an ethyl acetate solution. The chain extender may be uniformly distributed in PLA and TPS/PBAT mixed granules by using a spraying method; during the reaction, ethyl acetate is volatilized, and the chain extender is uniformly adsorbed on the surface of the granules; at a certain temperature and in the presence of a shear force of the twin screw, the chain extender may change the remaining short-chain molecules and terminal carboxyl molecules in the mixed granules into long-chain molecules in the short run (0.5-1 min). The compatibility of these two materials may be greatly improved in the chain extension process, and the hydrolytic resistance may be improved; the melting strength and mechanical properties of a blended material may be substantially improved, and the mechanical properties of the resin may be improved by 50% or above. The present disclosure only uses the chain extender as an auxiliary agent, and does not need to add any other auxiliary agent, and the modified biodegradable resin prepared is especially suitable for making a film, having superior mechanical properties.

The subject matter described herein relates to apparatuses, systems, and methods for improving safety at worksites.

BACKGROUND

Modern worksites often expose workers to safety hazards such as those caused by falls, construction equipment, machinery, exposure to toxic chemicals, electrocution, fire, heat exposure, drowning, vehicles, as well as other sources. Because the conditions in and around worksites are frequently changing, identifying and predicting hazards are challenging. Even when dangers are identified, ensuring that worksite personnel avoid the hazards commonly proves difficult.

A widespread tool for tracking personnel on job sites and during emergencies is the T-card system, which is a manual system subject to human error. For example, the names on the cards might not be updated, the wrong card could be flipped, the card might not be flipped at all (for example in an emergency situation or simply because the worker forgot), or the card may be placed in an incorrect slot. When the T-card system identifies that a person is missing, a rescue team is often dispatched to search for this missing person. Thus, when the T-card system produces inaccurate data, additional workers may unnecessarily be exposed to hazards and dangers at the worksite.

BACKGROUND

Technical Field

The present disclosure relates to a vehicle that can be boarded and exited in a wheelchair.

Related Art

A vehicle that an occupant of a wheelchair can board in the wheelchair and drive in the wheelchair has been known since heretofore (for example, see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0285146).

When an occupant of a wheelchair is on board this vehicle, the wheels of the wheelchair are locked by a brake provided at the wheelchair, and the occupant of the wheelchair is restrained in the vehicle by a seatbelt provided in the vehicle.

However, the brake provided at the wheelchair and the seatbelt provided in the vehicle are not a structure that secures the wheelchair itself relative to the vehicle. Therefore, when the vehicle accelerates, decelerates or the like, the possibility of the wheelchair moving relative to the vehicle due to inertial force cannot be eliminated. When the wheelchair moves relative to the vehicle, it may be difficult to assure safety of the occupant of the wheelchair.

SUMMARY

Accordingly, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a vehicle that may assure safety of an occupant of a wheelchair.

In order to achieve the object described above, a vehicle according to a first aspect of the present disclosure includes: a panel member provided at a vehicle body, the panel member opposing a wheelchair, which has boarded the vehicle, in a vehicle width direction; a front side securing member provided at the panel member, the front side securing member being caused to contact a front portion side of a handrim of the wheelchair or a front portion side of a wheel of the wheelchair; and a rear side securing member that presses a rear portion side of the handrim or a rear portion side of the wheel toward a vehicle body front side so as to push the front portion side of the handrim or the front portion side of the wheel against the front side securing member.

According to the first aspect of the present disclosure, the front side securing member and the rear side securing member sandwich in the vehicle front-and-rear direction and secure a front portion side and rear portion side of a handrim or wheel of a wheelchair. Therefore, when the vehicle accelerates, decelerates or the like, movement of the wheelchair itself relative to the vehicle due to inertial force may be suppressed. As a result, safety of an occupant of the wheelchair is assured.

In a vehicle according to a second aspect of the present disclosure, in the vehicle according to the first aspect, a rail member that extends in a vehicle body front-rear direction is provided at the panel member, and the front side securing member is movably supported at the rail member.

According to the second aspect of the present disclosure, the rail member that extends in the vehicle front-and-rear direction is provided at the panel member. Thus, stiffness of the panel member is improved and the panel member may withstand a side collision of the vehicle. That is, at the time of a side collision of the vehicle, safety of an occupant of the wheelchair is assured. Moreover, because the front side securing member is supported by the rail member to be movable, a position of the front side securing member may be altered, and the wheelchair can be positioned at a suitable position according to an outer diameter of the handrim or wheel of the wheelchair.

In a vehicle according to a third aspect of the present disclosure, in the vehicle according to the second aspect, the front side securing member is structured to be movable by a manual operation by an occupant of the wheelchair.

According to the third aspect of the present disclosure, the front side securing member can be moved by a manual operation by the occupant of the wheelchair. Therefore, the front side securing member may be moved expeditiously by a simple structure.

In a vehicle according to a fourth aspect of the present disclosure, in the vehicle according to the second aspect or third aspect, the rail member includes an upper and lower pair of rail members, and in a view seen in the vehicle body front-rear direction, the front side securing member comprises a set of two front side securing members respectively provided at an upper side and a lower side relative to a center of the handrim or a center of the wheel.

According to the fourth aspect of the present disclosure, the rail members are provided as an upper and lower pair. Therefore, stiffness of the panel member is improved more effectively, and the panel member may more effectively withstand a side collision of the vehicle. Moreover, the front side securing members are provided as a set of two at the upper and lower sides of the center of the handrim or the center of the wheel, as seen in the vehicle front-and-rear direction. Therefore, the front portion side of the handrim or wheel of the wheelchair is secured more effectively.

In a vehicle according to a fifth aspect of the present disclosure, in the vehicle according to the fourth aspect, seen in the vehicle body front-rear direction, the rear side fixing member is provided between the set of the two front side securing members.

According to the fifth aspect of the present disclosure, the rear side securing member is provided, as seen in the vehicle front-and-rear direction, between the front side securing members that are provided as a set of two. Thus, seen in the vehicle width direction, the handrim or wheel of the wheelchair is sandwiched and secured by the vertices of a substantial isosceles triangle whose altitude direction is in the vehicle front-and-rear direction. Therefore, the wheelchair may be more effectively and stably secured, and when the vehicle accelerates, decelerates or the like, movement of the wheelchair itself relative to the vehicle due to inertial force is more effectively suppressed or prevented.

In a vehicle according to a sixth aspect of the present disclosure, in the vehicle according to any one of the first to fifth aspects, the rear side securing member is structured as a mechanical structure that may be caused to press the rear portion side of the handrim or rear portion side of the wheel toward the vehicle body front side by a manual operation by an occupant of the wheelchair.

According to the sixth aspect of the present disclosure, the rear side securing member is structured by the mechanical structure. Pressing of the rear portion side of the handrim or wheel toward the vehicle body front side by the mechanical structure is enabled by a manual operation by an occupant of the wheelchair. Therefore, fabrication costs of the rear side securing member may be reduced compared to a structure that is moved by an electric mechanism.

In a vehicle according to a seventh aspect of the present disclosure, in the vehicle according to any one of the first to sixth aspects, the panel member includes a pair of panel members respectively disposed at a left side and a right side, and the front side securing member and the rear side securing member are provided so as to correspond to the handrim at each of the left side and the right side or the wheel at each of the left side and the right side.

According to the seventh aspect of the present disclosure, the panel members are arranged as a pair at left and right, and the front side securing members and rear side securing members are respectively provided at the left and right handrims or wheels. Therefore, the panel members may withstand a side collision of the vehicle more effectively, and the wheelchair is more stably secured.

In a vehicle according to an eighth aspect of the present disclosure, the vehicle according to any one of the first to seventh aspects further includes a retractable slope member at the lower side of a rear portion of a floor panel, the slope member enabling the wheelchair to board the vehicle when a back door is open.

According to the eighth aspect of the present disclosure, the retractable slope member is provided at the lower side of the rear portion of the floor panel. Therefore, an occupant of a wheelchair may board the vehicle expeditiously from the vehicle body rear side of the vehicle by using the slope member, and may move into a driving position without changing orientation.

According to the present disclosure as described above, safety of an occupant of a wheelchair may be assured.

Described in the above-mentioned patent specification EP 1 864 752 A1 is a further development of this system wherein a wireless data transfer takes place between the tool and the clamping mechanism. In a first variant the communication takes place in optical manner, while in another variant there is communication in electromagnetic manner

Both earlier systems make it possible to identify a tool in the clamping system of a press brake, so for instance to ascertain the type of tool and the dimensions thereof. The position of the tool in the clamping system can thus also be precisely determined, and data can be exchanged in ‘real time’ between the clamping system and the tool. On the basis of these data a control system can then check whether the tool is correct for the intended operation and is situated at the correct location. The control system can further indicate which tools must be placed at which positions in the clamping beam and can release the press brake for an operation at the moment that the tools are in the correct position. The control system can then indicate the sequence in which a workpiece must be processed by the different tools. Compared to conventional clamping systems, this system offers a great improvement in processing speed, precision and process reliability.

The securing device can be applied not only in a press brake or other machine, but also in a tool storage area. Here too position-determining of and communication with tools can be important, for instance in order to be able to find, fetch and replace tools in the storage area in an automated process.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention now has for its object to improve the system described above such that it functions in reliable and disturbance-free manner under practically all conditions. According to the invention this is achieved in a device of the above described type when it is provided with a first protective layer at least partially separating the locating and/or communication means from the receiving space. Such a protective layer prevents the locating and/or communication means being damaged by protruding parts of the tool, for instance burrs. Also thus prevented is that the operation of the locating and/or communication means is affected by dust, grease or dirt which collects in the receiving space and is possibly pressed between the locating and/or communication means and the tool.

The risk of damage is reduced still further when the locating and/or communication means are arranged in a recess in a wall of the receiving space and the first protective layer at least partially closes off the recess.

In a first embodiment of the device the locating and/or communication means are wholly closed off from the receiving space by the first protective layer. It is on the other hand possible that the first protective layer leaves clear at least a part of the locating and/or communication means. This latter can be particularly practical when the locating and/or communication means do not operate in contactless manner or do so only partially.

Although the position of the tool can be determined passively by capacitive or optical detection, the engaging part of the tool can also comprise a locating and/or communication element co-acting with the locating and/or communication means. In that case it is preferred that this locating and/or communication element is at least partially closed off from the surrounding area by a second protective layer. Both components of the locating and/or communication system are thus protected against ambient influences.

For optimal protection it is here also preferred that the locating and/or communication element is arranged in a recess in the engaging part of the tool and that the second protective layer at least partially closes off the recess from the surrounding area.

For optimal protection thereof the locating and/or communication element can be wholly closed off from the surrounding area by the second protective layer. The second protective layer can on the other hand, particularly in the case of non-contactless operation, leave clear at least one part of the locating and/or communication element.

In order to reduce the risk of damage still further, it is preferred that the recess has a depth such that the first and/or second protective layer is recessed therein. The chance of contact being made with the protective layer is thus very small, while the components of the locating and/or communication system are lie even further away.

According to a first variant of the device according to the invention, the first and/or second protective layer is manufactured from a material with a hardness which is at least as great as a hardness of the tool. The first and/or second protective layer can for instance comprise a material with a Mohs hardness greater than 5, preferably greater than 6, more preferably greater than 7 and most preferably greater than 8. The respective protective layer can thus withstand damage by protruding parts, for instance burrs on the tool. This can be achieved by choosing the material of the first and/or second protective layer from the group comprising: minerals; metals, in particular hardened types of steel; ceramic materials; and glass.

According to another variant of the device according to the invention, the first and/or second protective layer is manufactured from a material with a hardness which is considerably less than a hardness of the tool. Such materials can be ductile or shock absorbing, and thus ensure protection. The material of the first and/or second protective layer is preferably a self-restoring material. Any possible damage can thus be immediately rectified, whereby the protection is maintained.

The material of the first and/or second protective layer can be chosen from the group comprising: epoxy; optionally fibre-reinforced plastics; hot melts; and organic or inorganic substances.

The tool slides very easily into the receiving space when the first and/or second protective layer is provided with a smooth top layer facing toward the receiving space. The risk of dirt or grease adhering to the respective protective layer is thus also reduced.

So as not to affect the data transfer between the tool and the securing device, the material of the first and/or second protective layer is preferably not electrically conductive, or hardly so.

When the first and/or second protective layer is arranged directly on the locating and/or communication means or on the locating and/or communication element respectively, the component of the locating and/or communication system and the associated protective layer can be mounted as one whole in the receiving space or on the tool respectively.

It is on the other hand possible to envisage the first and/or second protective layer being arranged on the locating and/or communication means or on the locating and/or communication element respectively via a carrier, in particular an adhesive layer. There is therefore a greater freedom in the choice of materials for the protective layer because the carrier then forms the connection between the protective layer and the underlying component of the locating and/or communication system.

It is in that case moreover possible that the first and/or second protective layer is releasable. The layer can in this way be replaced, for instance when it is damaged or heavily fouled.

In order to guarantee a good communication between the components of the locating and/or communication system it is preferred that the material of the first and/or second protective layer has a relatively high dielectric value.

When the receiving space is elongate, the locating and/or communication means and the first protective layer preferably extend substantially along the length of the receiving space. Tools can thus be located at any position in the receiving space and the invention can therefore be applied along the whole length of the device.

When the device has means for clamping the tool in the receiving space, these can form part of a clamping system of a machine, in particular a press.

In order to prevent damage to the components it is then preferred that the device is provided with means for detecting contact of the tool with the first protective layer, which detection means are configured to interrupt a clamping of the tool. By interrupting the clamping as soon as it is determined that the tool has made contact with the protective layer it is possible to prevent the tool further damaging the protective layer and the component situated therebehind as the clamping force increases. The protective layer does not necessarily have to take a hard and scratch-resistant form or, conversely, a ductile and self-restoring form in this embodiment, because here the layer in the first instance fulfils the function of contact detector. The protective layer is therefore an active protective layer here which, in contrast to a passive protective layer, does not have to provide mechanical resistance—although it is of course possible to envisage the contact-detecting layer nevertheless taking a hard and scratch-resistant form or, conversely, a ductile and self-restoring form.

The invention also relates to a method for manufacturing a device of the above described type. Both of the above-mentioned earlier patent specifications of applicant already implicitly describe a method for manufacturing a device for securing a tool, in particular a bending tool, comprising the steps of forming a receiving space in a securing body for receiving an engaging part of the tool and arranging means in or close to the receiving space for locating and/or communicating with the tool.

The method according to the invention is distinguished herefrom by the step of arranging a first protective layer at least partially separating the locating and/or communication means from the receiving space.

This application describes apparatus and methods for overcoming technical challenges associated with on-demand encryption of email communication.

BACKGROUND

Conventional email messages and associated systems for email communication are relatively unsecure and are often targets of cyberattacks. An email message is typically created using an email client program running on a sender's computer terminal. An email client may also provide a user client for creating and managing email messages. For example, an email client may allow a user to create filters that automatically direct emails to a specific folder for later viewing. An email client may allow a user to archive and delete email messages.

The email client prepares the email message for transmission by combining the message content with header information. Header information may include a recipient address, subject, date, and time. After the email message has been composed by the client program, the email message is routed from the sender's computer terminal to a recipient computer terminal.

The email client may be capable of sending and receiving email messages using a variety of communication and transmission protocols. Commonly used protocols for email communication include Post Office Protocol (POP), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The email message may be routed through multiple computer until it arrives at the recipient's computer terminal.

The protocols may split an email message into multiple packets. Each packet may be sent independently from the sender to the recipient. Each packet may utilize a different route of computer terminals to arrive at the recipient computer terminal. The protocols provide mechanisms that allow routing computers to track which packets were successfully received, which packets were lost, and which packet may have been sent twice.

The communication protocols also provide mechanisms for reassembling received packets into the original transmitted email message. An illustrative protocol for email transmission may include a combination of Transmission Control Protocol (“TCP”) layered on top of an internet protocol (“IP”) that utilizes internet connected computers to route email message packets.

The typical sender or recipient of an email message is unaware of the technical details of how an email message is transmitted or routed. The popularity of email communications is due, at least in part, to insulating users from the technical complexities that control email communication.

However, typical email messages are transmitted as packets that include plain text. Plain text is readable by the interim computer systems that route email message packets to a destination. Absent any encryption, any computer system that participates in routing an email message can intercept and read contents of the email message. Conventional methods for encrypting email messages may include adding another layer of software on top of the TCP/IP protocols.

For example, another software program may encrypt an email message so that the contents of each packet are not viewable as plain text. However, such a scheme has various technical shortcomings.

First, encryption software used by the sender must be compatible with the sender's and recipient's email client programs. For example, the recipient's email client must be able to decrypt the email message encrypted by the send's email client.

Second, the sender must proactively call the encryption software to encrypt a target email message. The sender may not wish to encrypt all outgoing messages because of a computational load imposed on the sender's computer terminal, incompatibility with a recipient's email client or because some email messages do not include any confidential information. Thus, the conventional encryption techniques require regular human intervention, exacerbating the risk of human error and undermining the convenience of email communication.

Thirdly, an encrypted email message must be able to be decrypted and viewed by a recipient's email client program. Conventionally, the recipient must enter a passcode to access an encrypted message. This poses an additional hurdle that undermines the convenience of email communication. The recipient may also decrypt the email message on a computer terminal that is inherently unsecure. For example, the recipient may be accessing their email on a public internet station. Even if the email message was secured during transmission, confidential contents are still at risk of exposure at a time the message is read by the recipient.

It would be desirable to provide improvements to conventional techniques for encrypting email messages. For example, it would be desirable to provide technical improvements that provide encryption of email messages without requiring input from a sender. It would be desirable to provide technical improvements that allow encrypted email messages to be read by a recipient without requiring the recipient to enter a passcode to decrypt the message.

It would be it would be desirable to provide technical improvements that prevent an encrypted email message from being decrypted on an insecure computer terminal. It would be desirable to provide the aforementioned technical improvements without compromising the convenience of email communication. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide apparatus and methods for SECURE EMAIL TRANSMISSION VIA TREASURY PORTAL.

The present application claims priority to European Patent Application No. 21201780.0, filed on Oct. 8, 2021, and entitled “SUPPORT FOR A CAMERA DISPLAY OF A VEHICLE,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The invention relates to a support for a camera display of a vehicle. More precisely, the invention relates to a support for a camera display of a camera monitoring system.

The invention can be applied in heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks, buses and construction equipment. Although the invention will be described with respect to a heavy-duty vehicle, the invention is not restricted to this particular vehicle, but may also be used in other vehicles such as passenger vehicles.

BACKGROUND

Conventionally, vehicles are equipped with rear-view and side-view mirrors to enable a driver to see rearward or on the sides of the vehicle, for example, to detect obstacles at the left or right side and at the rear of the vehicle. The use of mirrors has however been unsatisfactory and we now meet a trend of replacing conventional mirrors with camera monitoring systems comprising a camera for capturing views of the sides or rear of the vehicle, and a display for displaying the views captured by the camera. These camera monitoring systems are intended to provide at least the functionalities provided by the conventional mirrors.

The display is generally disposed into the vehicle, close to a front door of the vehicle and at the upper interior surface of the windshield of the vehicle. In this manner a driver has a good visibility through the windshield of the vehicle and to the display.

Typically, the display is rigidly affixed around its periphery to a support, such as a bracket member, that is first adhered or otherwise rigidly affixed to the interior surface of the windshield. Because the display is disposed close to the front door of the vehicle, there is a risk that the front door hits the display when the driver slams the door. Thus there is a room for improvement for optimizing the position of the display and to avoid clash and breakage of the display.

SUMMARY

An object of the invention is to provide a support for a camera display of a vehicle, which support is configured to be disposed close to a door of the vehicle, and is movable in order to be in an optimal position when the door is closed and to move away from the door when the door is open.

An “optimal position” is a position optimized to get a wide and clear direct front vision through the windshield and to the camera display. Such an optimal position is as close as possible to the door to get better visibility both for direct visibility trough the windscreen and to the camera display.

The object is achieved by a support.

By the provision of a support which comprises a sensor configured to detect a position of the door between an open position and a closed position, the camera display is automatically moved from an optimal position when the door is in the closed position, and away from the door when the door is in the open position. Therefore, the camera display is automatically moved away from the door in movement in order to avoid any clash/breakage of the display.

According to one embodiment, the actuator is a rotating motor.

According to one embodiment, the actuator is an electric motor.

According to one embodiment, the sensor is a latch sensor.

According to one embodiment, the support further comprises a bracket configured to be attached to the pillar of the door of the vehicle.

According to one embodiment, the movable part is movable in rotation around a vertical axis.

A further object of the invention is a vehicle comprising a support as described above.

Further advantages and advantageous features of the invention are disclosed in the following description and in the dependent claims.

A. Technical Field

The present disclosure relates generally to information handling system. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for providing high availability of storage systems.

B. Background

As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use, such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.

Information handling systems are used to provide a number of services related to data storage and data acquisition. One of the relatively new standards in storage is non-volatile memory express over Fabrics (NVMe-oF™) with a new subset of NVMe® over Transmission Control Protocol (NVMe/TCP). One value of this new option is to have a common standard that allows application servers to access storage without having to install any special agents.

While these storage implementations provide improved storage functionality, they are not without problems. One problem is related to when a storage system has an interrupt event while interacting with a remote host. Consider by way of illustration, the network environment100depicted inFIG.1.

Assume that Host A105has established a connection with the storage system115over network110. As part of establishing a connection, there are connection parameters that are established. If the storage subsystem115experiences an interrupt event, it may need to reboot and go through the process of reestablishing the connection with the Host A105. The process of reestablishing the connection can be quite involved and may result in significant delays and lost data. Because these storage systems can be critical or important services, reducing delays and lost data should be paramount.

Accordingly, it is highly desirable to find new, more efficient ways to handle interrupt events with dealing with data processing.

The present invention relates to the field of braking systems for vehicles, and in particular the present invention relates to a disc brake caliper.

Very briefly, a disc brake consists of a disc, which is integral in rotation with the vehicle wheel, and a fixed caliper, in which a pair of pads carrying friction material are housed. The caliper also holds pistons which, by being hydraulically operated, push the pads against the disc surfaces, thus obtaining the braking by virtue of the action of the friction material.

The number and relative position of the pistons considerably influence the action of the disc brake; for example, important factors depend on them, such as caliper rigidity, from which a more or less prompt braking derives, friction material consumption evenness, and the like.

SUMMARY

It is the object of the present invention to obtain a disc brake caliper capable of obtaining a particularly prompt and immediate braking.

Such an object is achieved by a caliper made according to the claims. The claims dependent thereon describe variant embodiments.

1. TECHNICAL FIELD

The present principles generally relate to the domain of three-dimensional (3D) scene and volumetric video content. The present document is also understood in the context of the encoding, the formatting and the decoding of data representative of the texture and the geometry of a 3D scene for a rendering of volumetric video content on end-user devices such as mobile devices or Head-Mounted Displays (HMD).

2. BACKGROUND

The present section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art, which may be related to various aspects of the present principles that are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present principles. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.

Recently there has been a growth of available large field-of-view content (up to 360°). Such content is potentially not fully visible by a user watching the content on immersive display devices such as Head Mounted Displays, smart glasses, PC screens, tablets, smartphones and the like. That means that at a given moment, a user may only be viewing a part of the content. However, a user can typically navigate within the content by various means such as head movement, mouse movement, touch screen, voice and the like. It is typically desirable to encode and decode this content.

Immersive video, also called 360° flat video, allows the user to watch all around himself through rotations of his head around a still point of view. Rotations only allow a 3 Degrees of Freedom (3DoF) experience. Even if 3DoF video is sufficient for a first omnidirectional video experience, for example using a Head-Mounted Display device (HMD), 3DoF video may quickly become frustrating for the viewer who would expect more freedom, for example by experiencing parallax. In addition, 3DoF may also induce dizziness because of a user never only rotates his head but also translates his head in three directions, translations which are not reproduced in 3DoF video experiences.

A large field-of-view content may be, among others, a three-dimension computer graphic imagery scene (3D CGI scene), a point cloud or an immersive video. Many terms might be used to design such immersive videos: Virtual Reality (VR), 360, panoramic, 4π steradians, immersive, omnidirectional or large field of view for example.

Volumetric video (also known as 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) video) is an alternative to 3DoF video. When watching a 6DoF video, in addition to rotations, the user can also translate his head, and even his body, within the watched content and experience parallax and even volumes. Such videos considerably increase the feeling of immersion and the perception of the scene depth and prevent from dizziness by providing consistent visual feedback during head translations. The content is created by the means of dedicated sensors allowing the simultaneous recording of color and depth of the scene of interest. The use of rig of color cameras combined with photogrammetry techniques is a way to perform such a recording, even if technical difficulties remain.

While 3DoF videos comprise a sequence of images resulting from the un-mapping of texture images (e.g. spherical images encoded according to latitude/longitude projection mapping or equirectangular projection mapping), 6DoF video frames embed information from several points of views. They can be viewed as a temporal series of point clouds resulting from a three-dimension capture. Two kinds of volumetric videos may be considered depending on the viewing conditions. A first one (i.e. complete 6DoF) allows a complete free navigation within the video content whereas a second one (aka. 3DoF+) restricts the user viewing space to a limited volume called viewing bounding box, allowing limited translation of the head and parallax experience. This second context is a valuable trade-off between free navigation and passive viewing conditions of a seated audience member.

The amount of data of volumetric video content is important and requires large storage capacities and high bit-rate is needed to transport such data. Solutions to reduce the amount of data corresponding to those volumetric videos, for storage, transport or decoding purposes, represent a broad subject of research to investigate.

12097142	"BACKGROUND

The present disclosure relates to ostomy appliances, and more particularly to a customizable convex barrier ring for use with ostomy appliances for providing localized and customized convex support around a stoma.

Ostomy pouches for the collection of body waste output from a stoma are well known and used by individuals who have had surgery such as a colostomy, ileostomy or urostomy. Ostomy pouches are generally attached to a user via an ostomy barrier, which is configured to seal against peristomal skin surfaces and protect the peristomal surfaces from exposure to stomal effluent. However, the topography of stomas and peristomal surfaces surrounding stomas can vary among patients and providing a single ostomy appliance which can effectively seal against such different peristomal surfaces and stomas can be particularly challenging. For example, a stoma may protrude more or less, or may even be flush or recessed.

A person with an ostomy having a stoma that is flush or recessed may find that applying external support or pressure from a barrier in the peristomal region aids in directing the discharge of effluent from the stoma directly into the ostomy pouch which can prevent undesirable leakage of body waste output between the barrier and the pouch. Accordingly, the effectiveness of an adhesive seal between the ostomy barrier and the peristomal skin surface (i.e., a seal formed by the adhesive layer) may be prolonged. Thus, convex inserts and convex ostomy barriers, such as ADAPTR convex barrier rings available through the assignee of the present application, have been developed to apply pressure around such peristomal regions.

However, the convexity of a conventional convex ostomy barrier or insert is fixed and may not work efficiently for all ostomates. Thus, convex ostomy barriers and convex inserts of various convexity depths have been made available in the market. Further, an ostomate may wish to incrementally adjust the convexity of an ostomy barrier to achieve an optimal convexity for his/her topography of stoma.

Accordingly, for at least the above-noted reasons, there is a critical need in the art for a customizable ostomy appliance that can accommodate a variety of stomal features and provide a desired degree of convex support to particular localized regions around the stoma inlet/opening. There is further a desire to provide a customizable ostomy appliance that can provide varying degrees of support around the stoma inlet/opening and that can enable a user to adjust or set the amount of flexibility or rigidity to different support regions. There is further a need in the art for an ostomy appliance that can provide the necessary flexibility upon application without compromising the structural rigidity as a support when in use.

This application is a National Phase of PCT Patent Application No. PCT/EP2019/054235 having International filing date of Feb. 20, 2019, which claims the benefit of priority of German Patent Application No. 10 2018 103 790.2 filed on Feb. 20, 2018. The contents of the above applications are all incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein in their entirety.

FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a sensor mat for a surface sensor system, in particular for monitoring a room of a building, a surface sensor system for detecting an event in a room of a building and a method for producing a sensor mat for a surface sensor system.

From the prior art, for example, it is known to monitor a part of a room by a motion detector so that a movement of a person can be detected. However, it is a disadvantage that normally it can only be detected whether a movement has taken place in the room, but this movement cannot be localized. Furthermore, such motion detectors usually require a line of sight to the event, so that in a room of a building, for example, by placing furniture dead spaces can be created in which a detection of the event is not possible. In addition, such motion detectors are often installed as an additional structural element in a region of the room so that they are clearly visible and can therefore have a negative effect on the visual impression in the room. It is also often not possible to distinguish the presence of a plurality of persons from the presence of one person or even to assign changes in the position of individual persons to the respective persons. However, this can be of interest, for example, if streams of visitors in a department store are to be analyzed or the activity of individual persons in a room is to be monitored, for example, in order to detect an emergency of a person in a retirement home at an early stage.

It is an object of the present invention to at least partially remedy any prior disadvantages known from the prior art. In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a sensor system by means of which the detection of an event is improved and which can preferably be installed in a simple manner with an increased range of functions.

The above-mentioned object is solved by a sensor mat with the features of claim1, a surface sensor system with the features of claim41, and a method for producing a sensor mat with the features of claim42.

Further features and details of the invention result from the dependent claims, the description and the figures. Features and details which have been described in reference to the sensor mat according to the invention are of course also valid in reference to the surface sensor system and/or the method according to the invention and vice versa, so that with regard to the disclosure of the individual aspects of the invention reference is or can always be made to each other.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

According to the invention, the sensor mat for a surface sensor system, in particular for monitoring a room in a building, comprises a flexible base unit. The flexible base unit comprises a first carrier element which comprises a flat extension with a first base side and a second base side. Furthermore, the flexible base unit comprises at least one sensing means for detecting an event. The sensing means is arranged on the second base side of the first carrier element in such a way that the base unit can be laid flat for the design of the surface sensor system.

Preferably, the base unit and/or the sensor mat can be designed as a plate. In particular, the sensor mat can advantageously comprise a base area of less than 2 m×2 m, preferably of less than 1.5 m×1.5 m or less than 1 m×1 m, particularly preferably of less than 1.1 m×0.8 m or less than 0.7 m×0.7 m. Preferably, the sensor mat can be embedded in a limiting element of a room. In particular, the surface sensor system can comprise a floor sensor system for monitoring the room of the building. In addition or alternatively, it may be provided that the sensor mat can be partially or completely arranged in a wall of the room in order to emit the heat on the wall side. It is also conceivable that the base unit comprises a square base area. This can improve the handling and reduce the sensitivity to kinking.

The base unit is preferably designed as a film-like, in particular moisture-impermeable, composite. By the fact that the base unit is flexible, it can be understood that the base unit can be at least partially bent without destroying the functionality of the sensor mat. The first carrier element can preferably form a base body on which the sensing means is arranged. The fact that the sensing means is arranged on the second base side of the first carrier element can be understood in the sense of the present invention to imply that the sensing means is arranged, preferably fixed, directly or indirectly on the first carrier element. It is thus conceivable, for example, that further components of the sensor mat are arranged between the first carrier element and the sensing means and that the sensing means is only indirectly provided on the second base side. The term ‘on the second base side’ thus refers in particular to the orientation in relation to the first carrier element. Preferably, however, the sensing means can be arranged directly on a surface of the second base side of the first carrier element. In particular, the first carrier element can form a board for the sensing means and/or further components of the sensor mat.

The fact that the base unit can be laid flat for the design of the surface sensor system can be understood, in particular in the sense of the present invention, as meaning that at least the first carrier element and the sensing means form an assembly unit which can be pre-installed, in particular before installation on the construction site. Thus, in particular, the first carrier element and the sensing means can be laid flat together. The flat laying can be understood in particular to mean that the base unit can be arranged on a structural element of the building and/or the room, in particular in such a way that the flat extension of the first carrier element extends parallel or substantially parallel to the structural element of the room and/or the building. Preferably a plurality of sensor mats can be laid next to each other on the structural element of the building in order to form the surface sensor system.

Thus, at least part of a surface sensor system can be easily formed by the sensor mat according to the invention. For this purpose, the base unit can be laid flat as an assembly unit, wherein in particular the first carrier element and the sensing means can be pre-installed. This simplifies the installation of the surface sensor system considerably, since, for example, particularly advantageous structures of the sensing means can already be specified together with the base unit and the installer can only adapt the base unit to the conditions of the room or building. In addition, the sensor mat can be prefabricated in a separate production environment, so that the sensor mat can be delivered as a whole to the respective construction site of the building. This results in shorter installation times on site, so that the costs for the surface sensor system or the installation of the surface sensor system can be reduced. In particular, the sensor mat can be produced in a series production.

The sensor mat can be used, for example, to monitor a room to see if a person enters it, for example if the occupant of the room is on holiday. It is conceivable, for example, that the detection of a person could provide a monitoring functionality of the sensor mat, which determines whether a person is in the room and/or moves in the room, in particular in a certain way. It is also conceivable that, for example, the sensor mat could be used in a health care region, for example in a retirement home, to detect whether an occupant of the room is moving and, if necessary, to initiate countermeasures if the occupant does not move for a long period of time.

It is further conceivable that in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, the sensing means is in a firmly-bonded connection to the first carrier element, in particular wherein the sensing means is printed onto the first carrier element, preferably by means of screen printing. Thus, even if the sensing means is present, series production of the sensor mat with increased functionality may be favored. At the same time, a firmly-bonded connection between the carrier element and the sensing means offers a simple possibility to ensure a safe connection. As an alternative to an imprint, the sensing means can also be welded, glued or similar to the first carrier element in order to connect the sensing means with the first carrier element in a firmly-bonded connection. In addition or as an alternative to a firmly-bonded connection, it is further conceivable that the sensing means is connected to the first carrier element in a form-fit and/or force-locking manner, wherein, for example, a wire of the sensing means may be interwoven with the first carrier element or the sensing means may be riveted to the first carrier element.

Advantageously, in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it can be provided that the sensing means comprises at least two, preferably four, sensor elements each comprising a sensing region. In particular, the sensing regions may differ at least in some regions. It is also conceivable that the sensing means comprises further sensor elements with further sensing regions. The sensing regions enable an increase in the accuracy of the detection of the event and/or the range of possible detectable events. Thus, it is conceivable that the event detects a change in the sensing regions over time, so that a movement of a person can be inferred. It is also conceivable that a person moves in a certain direction over the sensor mat, which can be detected by the sensing regions when the person leaves one sensing region and enters another sensing region. In addition or alternatively, the sensing regions can be used to mutually validate a signal from the detection of the event to reduce measurement errors. Furthermore, it is conceivable, for example, that the event is detected in each of the sensing regions and thus the actual presence of the event can be inferred. In addition, the at least two sensor elements can ensure that the sensor mat can be cut to size, for example to adapt to the geometry of the room, without completely losing the function of the sensing means. Thus, it may be provided that one of the sensor elements will still function even if another sensor element is separated from the sensor mat, for example to take into account a corner of a room or a limitation of the room. Four sensor elements have proven to be particularly advantageous because they can be easily connected to a central evaluation unit. Furthermore, a division into four sensor elements comprises a positive effect on the manageability of the sensor mat in terms of size as well as the ability to be cut to size. The sensor elements can preferably comprise a base area of greater than or equal to 200 mm×200 mm, preferably greater than or equal to 300×300 mm.

Within the scope of the invention, the sensing means may further comprise at least one electrode for capacitive detection of the event. Thus, at least part of a capacitance may be formed by the sensing means, in particular part of a plate capacitor. The electrode can thereby act together with a part of the body of a person, whereby the part of the body of the person being able to form the counter-electrode for producing the capacitance. A change in capacitance may thus indicate the movement of the person. Capacitive detection of the event enables the execution of the detection in a simple way, for example through a floor cover in the case of a floor sensor system. Thus, the detection can be based on an electric field, which in particular can act through at least one structural element of the building. Furthermore, capacitive detection can provide a low-energy option for monitoring at least part of the room. In particular, at least one electrode can be assigned to each sensor element.

In the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it may also be provided that the sensing means comprises at least two electrodes, in particular for capacitive detection of the event, by which an electric field can be jointly generated. Thus, for example, it is not necessary for the body part of a person to be detected, to form part of the capacitance. Rather, an electric field can already be generated, in particular by the sensor elements, wherein the presence of a person in the electric field can cause a change in the electric field. This can further increase the accuracy of the sensing means for detection. Furthermore, the sensing means can thereby be less sensitive to interference effects of other structural elements of the building, such as a functional cover and/or a visual cover of the room and/or a floor. In particular, at least two electrodes can be assigned to each sensor element.

Furthermore, it is conceivable that the sensing means comprises an electrode which is designed as a shield electrode for limiting an electric field. In particular, one of the two electrodes, by which the electric field can be generated, can be designed as a shield electrode. By means of the shield electrode, the electric field can be shielded from the outside and spread at least substantially within the limitation of the shield electrode and/or be protected at least substantially by the limitation of the shield electrode against external influences. The accuracy of the measurement, in particular the capacitive measurement, by the sensing means can thus be improved. Preferably, the shield electrode may be formed on one edge of the sensing means and/or around a plurality of electrodes, in particular around each of the sensor elements, at least substantially, in particular completely circumferentially. This allows an advantageous shielding of the sensing means and/or each of the sensing regions to be realized.

In the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it is also conceivable that, in particular on the first and/or second base side of the first and/or second carrier element, a sound insulation layer is arranged. The sound insulation layer can serve in particular to absorb impact sound. If a sensing means is present, sound bridges of the sensor elements can be reduced or avoided by the sound insulation layer. Impact sound can be understood to be sound which can be caused by the movement of a person on a floor. This sound in particular can be attenuated by the sound insulation layer. The sound insulation layer can comprise a fiber board, foam and/or fleece. Thus, the sensor mat can simultaneously guarantee a functionality of the floor, by which at least a part of the floor is decoupled with regard to sound. This can have a positive effect on a person's perception of impact sound on the floor. Preferably, the sound insulation layer can be arranged on the base unit, in particular directly on the base unit.

Within the scope of the invention it may further be provided that, in particular on the first base side of the first carrier element and/or on the second carrier element, a sealing layer is arranged on the base unit. Preferably, the sealing layer may comprise at least one fiber layer. Preferably, the sealing layer can extend flat over the entire or substantially the entire base unit. By the term ‘substantially’, it can be understood that only some edge regions are free of the sealing layer in order to guarantee a connection, for example with further sensor mats. The sealing layer is preferably used to prevent moisture from the room from reaching the base unit, or at least to reduce the amount of moisture reaching the base unit, in order to protect the electrical components of the base unit from moisture and/or possible corrosion. This can be particularly advantageous if, for example, the sensor mat is to be installed in a damp room, such as a bathroom. The sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer can also be prefabricated on the base unit and delivered to a construction site together with the base unit. Thus, further installation can be avoided at the construction site and/or series production, in particular off-site, can be favored.

Preferably, the sealing layer of a sensor mat according to the invention can comprise a non-woven fabric. The non-woven fabric can be inexpensive to produce and at the same time provide a high sealing functionality with good compatibility with other surrounding materials. In particular, the non-woven fabric can also simultaneously absorb impact sound, so that further advantages can result when using the sensor mat in a floor sensor system. Furthermore, the non-woven fabric can also be used on site as well as be easy to process away from the construction site.

Within the scope of the invention, it is further conceivable that the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer is fixed to the base unit with an adhesive layer. Preferably, both the sealing layer and the sound insulation layer can be fixed to the base unit with an adhesive layer each. The adhesive layer may in particular comprise a double-sided adhesive tape. The adhesive layer can be used to easily fix the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer to the base unit, while at the same time facilitating series production. In particular, in combination with a double-sided adhesive tape, this simplifies to mount the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer on the base unit. At the same time, the adhesive layer can be used, for example in an edge region, to enable two adjacent sensor mats to be connected to each other in a simple manner when designing the surface sensor system, without the need for further aids.

Advantageously, in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, the base unit is bendable, in particular wherein an achievable bending angle of the base unit is greater than or equal to 10°, preferably greater than or equal to 45°, particularly preferably greater than or equal to 90°. The achievable bending angle can in particular be understood as a permissible bending angle which does not destroy or substantially impair the function of the sensor mat. It may be provided that the base unit comprises a bending radius when bent. In particular, an achievable bending angle must therefore be distinguished from a kinking of the base unit. Due to the high flexibility of the base unit and the bendability, a simple installation and a high robustness of the sensor mat during transport and installation can be guaranteed. For example, it may not be necessary to carry the sensor mat with special care with a plurality of people. In particular, for example, a stack of sensor mats can be delivered to the construction site and a sensor mat can be removed from the stack by one person.

Within the scope of the invention, it is further conceivable that the sensor mat forms a sensor module which can be connected together with further sensor modules for the design of the surface sensor system. A sensor module can thus be understood as an assembly unit which, together with other assembly units, forms the surface sensor system. Thus, the sensor mat can only form a part of the surface sensor system, wherein a plurality of sensor mats, in particular in combination with further components, can form the surface sensor system. It is conceivable, for example, that each sensor module comprises a manually manageable dimensioning and can thus be conveniently handled on the construction site. Depending on the geometry of the room, the design as a sensor module also offers the advantage that the surface sensor system can be adapted to the size of the room by varying the number of installed sensor modules.

Within the scope of the invention it is further conceivable that an electrical heating means is provided for emitting heat, in particular wherein the base unit comprises the electrical heating means. Thus, in addition to the sensor functionality of the sensor mat, the functionality of the sensor mat can be extended in such a way that at the same time a heating function is provided by which the room can be heated. Preferably, the heating power of the electrical heating means can be up to 1 kW/m2, preferably up to 300 W/m2, in particular preferably between 150 and 300 W/m2or 120 to 200 W/m2. In particular, in order to favor the flexibility and simple installation of the flexible base unit, the first carrier element may comprise a thickness of up to 2 mm, preferably up to 1 mm, particularly preferably approximately 0.5 mm. For the purpose of the present invention, the indication ‘approximately’ can be understood as a deviation within the usual tolerances. In particular, it is further conceivable that for the intended use of the sensor mat, the electrical heating means for forming the surface heating system can be arranged on the floor side and the sensing means can be arranged above the electrical heating means. Preferably, the electrical heating means can emit the heat through the sensing means or past the sensing means, so that both functionalities of the sensor mat can be ensured in an advantageous way in a layered compound of the sensor mat.

Preferably, in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it may be provided that the base unit comprises a second carrier element on which the electrical heating means is arranged, in particular wherein the heating means and/or the sensing means is arranged between the first and the second carrier element. In this way, the heating means and the sensing means can be arranged independently of one another and/or separately from one another. By the arrangement of the heating means and/or the sensing means between the first and the second carrier element, the heating means and/or the sensing means is at least partially protected by the first and second carrier element. Thus, on the one hand, the carrier elements can each provide a base to which the heating means and the sensing means can be applied, preferably printed. On the other hand, protection against environmental influences can also be guaranteed. The heating means is preferably arranged on a first base side of the second carrier element, wherein the second base side of the first carrier element and the first base side of the second carrier element face each other. This allows the heating means and the sensing means to be arranged between the first and second carrier element. Preferably each of the carrier elements can comprise a thickness of less than or equal to 1 mm, preferably less than or equal to 0.5 mm, more preferably less than or equal to 0.1 mm.

Within the scope of the invention, it may further be provided that an intermediate element is arranged between the first and second carrier element, by means of which the first carrier element is at least partially, preferably completely, spaced apart from the second carrier element. By means of the intermediate element, the heating means can be electrically insulated from the sensing means and/or spatially separated from the sensing means. Furthermore, disturbance variables between the heating means and the sensing means can be reduced or avoided. In particular, the accuracy of the sensing of the event by the sensing means can thus be improved if the heating means is at a distance from the sensing means. Preferably, the intermediate element is designed as a sound insulation layer. Thus, the intermediate element can take over a plurality of functions. Firstly, impact sound can be damped by the intermediate element. On the other hand, the distance between the heating means and the sensing means can be realized by the intermediate element. Preferably, an adhesive layer can be arranged between the intermediate element and the first carrier element and/or between the intermediate element and the second carrier element. It is also conceivable that the intermediate element is designed as an insulating layer for thermal insulation.

Within the scope of the invention it may further be provided that the electrical heating means is arranged on the first base side of the first and/or second carrier element in such a way that the base unit can be laid flat for the design of a surface heating system. Thus, in addition to the surface sensor system, a surface heating system can also be provided by the sensor mat and can be formed together when the base unit is laid flat. Thus, for example, the room can be heated over a larger, in particular over the entire, surface. In particular, the sensor mat can also form a heating module which, together with further heating modules, forms the surface heating system. The arrangement of the electrical heating means on the first base side can also be provided directly or indirectly on the first and/or second carrier element. In particular, the electrical heating means can thus be laid flat together with the sensing means and the first and/or second carrier element. The electrical heating means can thus comprise the same advantages as those already explained with respect to the sensing means or the base unit with regard to simple installation, while at the same time increased functionality of the sensor mat can be guaranteed by the electrical heating means.

Within the scope of the invention it is further conceivable that the electrical heating means is in a firmly-bonded connection to the first and/or second carrier element. In particular, the electrical heating means can be directly or indirectly printed onto the first and/or second carrier element, preferably by means of screen printing. This can further simplify series production of the sensor mat. The firmly-bonded connection of the electrical heating means can be provided directly or indirectly with the first and/or second carrier element. For this purpose, the electrical heating means can be directly connected to the first and/or second carrier element or intermediate components, in particular layers, can be provided which are also connected to the first and/or second carrier element in a firmly-bonded manner. By a firmly-bonded connection of the electrical heating means and the carrier element, a high strength of the base unit can also be achieved, so that the electrical heating means and the first and/or second carrier element cannot be separated easily on the construction site. By a pressure of the electrical heating means on the first and/or second carrier element, the electrical heating means can further be precisely positioned on the first and/or second carrier element and also the geometry of the electrical heating means can be precisely specified. Screen printing offers a convenient way to provide conductive structures on the first and/or second carrier element. In particular, the electrical heating means can thus comprise a printable material. In addition or alternatively, the electrical heating means can be connected to the first and/or second carrier element in a form-fit and/or force-locking manner.

In the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it is further conceivable that the electrical heating means comprises at least one resistor element, preferably extending on the first base side of the first and/or second carrier element. Preferably, the resistor element can be designed flat, preferably plate-like. The heating power of the electrical heating means can thus be provided by the resistor element, wherein the heating power can vary depending on the electrical resistance of the resistor element. Furthermore, by means of a flat, preferably plate-like, design of the resistor element, a constant heating power can be achieved over a large region of the sensor mat, while at the same time a thickness of the resistor element, i.e. in particular an extension in a perpendicular direction to the first base side of the first and/or second carrier element, can be kept small. This, in turn, favors the arrangement of the sensor mat, for example, in a floor of the room, so that the floor may not be raised or only slightly raised due to the sensor mat. It is also particularly advantageous that the electrical heating means can be arranged directly on the first and/or second carrier element. This can simplify the production of the sensor mat considerably.

With a sensor mat according to the invention, it is also conceivable that the resistor element comprises a cured carbon paste. Preferably, the carbon paste may comprise a carbon and/or a filler. The ratio of carbon to filler can preferably be between 25 and 75% by weight of the carbon paste. In particular, the carbon paste may contain a ground carbon in powder form. In particular, the carbon paste can be printed in a simple manner on the first and/or second carrier element, so that a firmly-bonded connection, for example between the electrical heating means and the first and/or second carrier element, can be easily produced. Such a carbon paste is also particularly suitable for screen printing and for adhesion to plastics. Thus, the first and/or second carrier element can be produced of a favorable material and at the same time a firmly-bonded connection with the resistor element can be favored. The filler can be used to adjust the heating power of the carbon paste or the resistor element. In particular, the heating power of the carbon paste may vary during production of the carbon paste, e.g. depending on a supplier or production of the carbon. In order to still achieve a given heating power within a given tolerance, the filler can be added to reduce or increase the conductivity of the carbon paste.

The invention may also provide that a temperature sensor is provided for calibrating the electrical heating means. Preferably, the temperature sensor may be arranged on or adjacent to the base unit. By means of the temperature sensor, for example, the electrical heating means can be calibrated when the sensor mat is put into operation, wherein the heating power can be adapted to the environmental conditions. In particular, a reference temperature can thus be set which the electrical heating means should reach in order to achieve a certain room temperature assigned to the reference temperature. Furthermore, the temperature sensor can also be used to adjust the electrical heating means when the sensor mat is in operation. For example, depending on the current temperature, it may be provided that the electrical heating means is supplied with more or less power. The temperature sensor can preferably comprise a thermocouple or an NTC resistor. Thus, the temperature sensor can be designed small in order to keep the installation space requirement of the sensor mat low. It is also conceivable that the temperature sensor is arranged in a flush-mounted device in which a control unit can also be arranged, for example. Thus, a central temperature sensor can be provided for the surface heating system, wherein the temperature sensor can be provided for the sensor mat, and preferably for further sensor mats.

In the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it may further be provided that the first and/or second carrier element comprise a plastic, preferably a thermoplastic, particularly preferably a polyester, or consist of a plastic, preferably a thermoplastic, particularly preferably a polyester. As already described above, a plastic offers a simple and inexpensive possibility of providing a firmly-bonded connection with the resistor element of the electrical heating means. In particular, the first and/or second carrier element can comprise a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or consist of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Thus, the first and/or second carrier element can be produced in a simple manner, for example in the form of a film. This can in turn have a positive effect on simple series production, since the first and/or second carrier element can be produced as, for example, as a strip material and can be cut to size depending on the dimensions of the sensor mat. In addition, a plastic offers good resistance to environmental conditions, in particular to corrosion or similar. Thus, the formation of the first and/or second carrier element by means of plastic can simultaneously provide a chemical resistance of the first and/or second carrier element and thus at least partially of the base unit to building materials, for example of a floor of the room. In particular, the first and second carrier element can be of the same material.

In the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it is also conceivable that the electrical heating means is at least partially covered by a first electrically insulating protective layer and/or the sensing means is at least partially covered by a second electrically insulating protective layer. In particular, the first and/or second electrically insulating protective layer may be part of the base unit. Thus, in particular, a simple series production of the base unit is possible if, for example, the electrical heating means and/or the sensing means is printed on the first carrier element and then covered with an electrically insulating protective layer. The first and/or second electrically insulating protective layer may preferably comprise a polymer, in particular a photoresist. In particular, the first and/or second electrically insulating protective layer may be printed on the first carrier element and/or the heating means and/or the sensing means in order to provide a protective effect. By using a photoresist for the first and/or second electrically insulating protective layer, the production of the sensor mat can be simplified, for example, in that the photoresist is applied in liquid form and is cured by exposure, in particular ultraviolet exposure. In particular, the photoresist can thus be a negative resist.

Within the scope of the invention it is further conceivable that the base unit comprises at least one electrical connection, in particular for connection to an energy source and/or to a control unit. Preferably, the electrical connection may comprise a connection means for reversibly connecting the electrical heating means and/or the sensing means to the energy source and/or the control unit. By means of the electrical connection, an interface can be made available in a simple manner by which the sensor mat can be connected to an energy source and/or a control unit. The connection to the energy source and/or to the control unit can be provided indirectly, wherein, for example, further sensor mats can be connected in between. For improved electrical contact, the connection means can preferably be connected to the base unit by means of an electrically conductive adhesive. The reversible connection of the electrical heating means to the energy source and/or the control unit can further simplify the installation of the sensor mat for designing the surface heating system. For example, the electrical connection may include a push-button and/or an eyelet to ensure the reversible connection of the electrical heating means to the energy source and/or the control unit. In particular, the reversible connection also makes it possible, for example in the event of incorrect installation, to ensure easy release, in particular non-destructive release, which can further simplify the installation of the surface heating system as a whole. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the connection means comprises an electrical contact, in particular an exposed one, on the base unit.

Furthermore, in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it may be provided that the electrical connection comprises a connection interface for connecting the electrical heating means and/or the sensing means to a connection unit for connecting the connection interface to a counter-connection interface, in particular wherein the connection interface comprises at least one alignment means by which a mal-positioning of the connection unit can be prevented. The alignment means may comprise openings and/or projections which correspond to a positioning aid of the connection unit. In particular, the connection unit may be provided as an additional assembly which is added only when the surface heating system is installed. The connection unit can be used to create a simple, construction site-specific connection option. A plurality of, preferably three, openings can be provided. With an appropriate arrangement of the alignment means, only a correct or a correct and an obviously or conspicuously wrong position of the connection unit at the connection interface can be possible. The connection interface can advantageously be designed to be connected to the connection unit in a force-locking, firmly-bonded and/or form-fit connection. In particular, the connection interface can be designed for a magnetic connection with the connection unit. For this purpose, the connection interface can comprise a magnet or a magnetizable material. This can create a particularly simple and, in particular, construction site compatible connection possibility.

Furthermore, it may be provided within the scope of the invention that the connection interface comprises a recess in the base unit for receiving the connection unit, in particular wherein the recess is at least partially limited by the first and/or second carrier element. The recess may in particular comprise a cut-out from the intermediate element and the first and/or second carrier element. In this way a simple receptacle for the connecting unit can be created. In recesses to which no connection unit is to be attached, a dummy piece may be provided by which the connection interface is protected. If the recess is limited by the first, preferably the second, carrier element, a connection means in the form of an electrical contact may be provided on the first and/or second carrier element so that the connecting unit can easily be brought into electrical contact with the sensor mat. It is also conceivable that the first and/or second carrier element is magnetically clamped in the connection unit. This can improve electrical contact and fixation of the connection unit to the sensor mat.

The invention may further provide that the electrical connection comprises a heating connection which is connected to the electrical heating means and/or a data connection which is connected to the sensing means. Preferably, the electrical connection may comprise a heating connection and a data connection. However, it is also conceivable that the heating connection and the data connection are spatially separated, in particular arranged on different sides of the sensor mat. Through the heating connection, it may be possible to supply the electrical heating means with energy. It is also conceivable that the electrical heating means is also controlled by the heating connection. The control can be provided, for example, by switching a current on or off at the electrical heating means. The data connection can also be used to enable the sensing means to communicate with the control unit. In particular, the data connection can also be used to ensure that the sensing means is supplied with energy. Thus, a voltage can be applied to the heating connection and/or the data connection. In particular, the heating connection and the data connection can be provided together at the electrical connection, so that the connection of the sensor mat to further sensor mats and/or to a control unit and/or to an energy source can be accomplished intuitively in a simple way, while the installer can concentrate on the electrical connection. In particular, this can simplify installation to the extent that the error rate when connecting the sensor mat can be reduced.

In the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it is further conceivable that the electrical connection is arranged in an edge region of the base unit, in particular wherein the electrical heating means is connected to the electrical connection by at least one conductor track and/or wherein the electrical heating means is arranged in a central region of the first and/or second carrier element. The arrangement of the electrical connection in the edge region of the base unit can thus enable simple connection of the base unit and/or the sensor mat without impairing the functionality of the heating means and/or the sensing means. A connection between the heating means and the electrical connection can be made in a simple manner by means of the conductor track. By arranging the electrical heating means in the central region of the first and/or second carrier element, it can also be designed for a flat functionality of the heating power. An overlapping of a plurality of resistor elements, when arranging a plurality of sensor mats next to each other, is not necessary if the electrical connection and the electrical heating means are spatially separated.

Within the scope of the invention, it may further be provided that the electrical heating means comprises a heating conductor element by which the resistor element is connected to the conductor track. In particular, the heating conductor element can be arranged directly on the first and/or second carrier element. The heating conductor element can preferably comprise a different material than the resistor element. The heating conductor element can preferably comprise a noble metal, preferably silver. This means that the heating conductor element can comprise a lower resistance than the resistor element, so that the losses due to electrical resistance can be kept low by contacting or electrically coupling the electrical heating means with the conductor track, and thus the resistor element comprises the decisive part of the heat development and energy absorption. In order to achieve a particularly simple design, the heating conductor element can, for example, be arranged directly on the first and/or second carrier element and the resistor element directly on the heating conductor element. Thus, in particular, a firmly-bonded connection of the heating conductor element with the first and/or second carrier element and/or the resistor element can be provided. This means that the sensor mat can comprise only a small overall thickness and at the same time the design can be kept simple.

It is advantageous that, with a sensor mat according to the invention, the conductor path can be in a firmly-bonded connection to the first and/or second carrier element. In particular, the conductor path can be printed onto the first and/or second carrier element. In particular, the conductor track can be applied to the first and/or second carrier element by means of screen printing. This ensures a secure connection of the conductor track to the first and/or second carrier element, while at the same time series production of the sensor mat can be simplified.

Within the scope of the invention, it is further conceivable that the conductor path, in particular in the edge region of the base unit, is arranged circumferentially around the first and/or second carrier element. This allows the sensor mat to be easily adapted to room geometries by cutting it to size without, for example, completely destroying the functionality of the heating means. Thus, for example, individual resistor elements can be cut off while other resistor elements are still functioning, as these can preferably be connected to the conductor track with a plurality of heating conductor elements or can be connected to the surrounding conductor track at a plurality of points.

It may be advantageous in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention that a plurality of sensor elements of the sensing means are arranged in a regular distribution pattern, in particular on the second base side of the first carrier element. This can result in an advantageous monitoring functionality of the sensing means, wherein, on the one hand, an assignment of the individual sensor elements in the room can be simplified if the distribution pattern is regularly formed, and, on the other hand, cutting the sensor mat to size can also be favored. Furthermore, a plurality of sensor elements can form overlapping or adjacent sensing regions which can be used for validation during the detection of an event. Thus, by laying a single sensor mat, a plurality of sensor elements can be laid at the same time, so that the installation of the surface heating system can be simplified overall, in particular accelerated. Additionally or alternatively, it may be provided that a plurality of resistor elements of the electrical heating means are arranged in a regular distribution pattern, in particular on the first base side of the first carrier element. The resistor elements can thereby favor a cuttability of the sensor mat and/or enable a homogeneous heat distribution over a surface of the sensor mat.

Within the scope of the invention it is further conceivable that the sensing means is connected to at least one decentralized evaluation unit, in particular for processing sensor data of the sensing means. Preferably, the decentralized evaluation unit is electrically and/or mechanically connected to a data line of the base unit by means of electrically conductive adhesive. The decentralized evaluation unit can thus be part of the sensor mat and preferably be pre-installed on the base unit. With the decentralized evaluation unit, it is possible to tap the sensor data close to the sensor elements or the sensing element, so that no or only slight losses occur during the transmission of the sensor data. This can comprise a positive effect on the accuracy and/or reliability of the sensing means, in particular in the case of capacitive sensing. The decentralized evaluation unit can preferably comprise an analog-digital converter, in particular on a circuit board. Thus, for example, it can be provided that the decentralized evaluation unit converts analog sensor signals into digital signals and transfers them to a central control apparatus. Thus, the required installation space of the evaluation unit can be small, but at the same time an increased accuracy and/or reliability can be provided. In particular, each of the sensor elements of the sensing means can be connected to a respective decentralized evaluation unit. This means that a respective sensor signal can be tapped and at least partially processed in the, in particular, direct vicinity of the sensor elements, so that losses during transmission can be kept low. Additionally or alternatively, the decentralized evaluation unit can be connected to each of the sensor elements of the sensor mat. Thus, one decentralized evaluation unit per sensor mat can be sufficient to process the sensor data of all sensor elements of the sensor mat. On the one hand, this comprises the advantage that the lines for the, in particular, analogue sensor data up to the decentralized evaluation unit can be kept short, and at the same time only one decentralized evaluation unit is used per sensor mat. The decentralized evaluation unit can preferably comprise a printed circuit board, a processor, in particular a microprocessor, and/or other electronic structural elements. Preferably, the decentralized evaluation unit can be covered with a casting compound, which, in particular comprises a synthetic resin, or consists of a synthetic resin. This can protect the electrical components of the decentralized evaluation unit.

With a sensor mat according to the invention, it is also conceivable that the sensing means and/or the decentralized evaluation unit can be connected to a central control apparatus. In particular, any decentralized evaluation unit can be connected to the central control apparatus. In this way, the data can be transferred from the decentralized evaluation unit to the central control apparatus in a simple manner, wherein, as described above, the decentralized evaluation unit can be designed in a simple manner, while complex computing operations, for example, can be executed by the central control apparatus. This means that the computing capacity can be concentrated in the central control apparatus, for example. Preferably, the central control apparatus is part of a control unit through which, for example, the electrical heating means can also be controlled.

Advantageously, in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, the central evaluation unit can be arranged on the first base side or the second base side of the first and/or second carrier element on the base unit. Preferably, the decentralized evaluation unit can be at least partially embedded in the sound insulation layer. Thus, the sound insulation layer can simultaneously comprise a protective effect for the evaluation unit, so that if the sensor mat is stressed in the region of the decentralized evaluation unit, the sound insulation layer can yield slightly so that the stress cannot completely affect the decentralized evaluation unit. Furthermore, embedding the decentralized evaluation unit in the sound insulation layer can ensure that the installation space for designing the sensor mat is used effectively, so that the thickness of the sensor mat can be limited.

Within the scope of the invention it is further conceivable that the base unit comprises at least one data line which is in communication connection with the sensing means and/or with the decentralized evaluation unit. The data line may in particular be provided separately from the conductor track and enable the sensing means to be connected to the data connection. In this way a connection possibility can be created in a simple manner, through which data of the sensing means can be transported to further components of the surface heating system. In particular, the data line can be arranged on the first and/or second carrier element. This can create a simple connection possibility if the connection interface comprises a recess. It is thus conceivable that the data line is arranged on the first base side of the second carrier element so that electrical contact at the electrical connection for the heating means and the sensing means via the second carrier element can be realized.

Furthermore, with a sensor mat according to the invention, it is conceivable that the decentralized evaluation unit extends at least partially into a receiving opening of the intermediate element. Thus, the decentralized evaluation unit can be embedded e.g. in the intermediate element and at least partially be protected from external influences by the intermediate element. Furthermore, a thickness of the sensor mat can be kept small if the decentralized evaluation unit does not or only partially protrude from the base unit. For example, the receiving opening can be cut into the intermediate element. Additionally or alternatively, it can be provided that at least one sensor element of the sensing means is connected to the data line through the decentralized evaluation unit. Thus, for example, a transition of the sensor data from the first to the second carrier element and vice versa can also be realized by the decentralized evaluation unit, in particular if the decentralized evaluation unit extends into the intermediate element at the same time.

Furthermore, in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it is conceivable that the decentralized evaluation unit and/or the heating means is electrically coupled to the electrical connection by a connection section, in particular wherein a data line and/or at least part of a conductor track is formed by the connection section. The connecting section can preferably be arranged on the first base side of the second carrier element, in particular printed on the first base side of the second carrier element. In this way a direct connection of the decentralized evaluation unit with the electrical connection can be created in a simple manner. Sensor data can be transmitted to a control unit via the connection section. Furthermore, the heating means can be supplied with current via the connection section or a potential can be applied to a resistor element of the heating means.

Preferably, in the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it may be provided that a plurality of electrical connections, in particular for connection to an energy source and/or to a control unit, is arranged in an edge region of the base unit, in particular wherein a plurality of connection sections extend from the decentralized evaluation unit, preferably in a cross-like manner, to the electrical connections. The decentralized evaluation unit can preferably be arranged centrally on the base unit. The electrical connections are preferably arranged in an edge region of the base unit. Thus, a short distance can be achieved by the cross-like design of the connection sections. In particular, the connection sections can be connected via the decentralized evaluation unit or at least partially directly to each other. In particular, the heating conductor element can comprise connection sections that are connected to each other circumferentially. This can improve the ability to cut the sensor mat to size if a cut through one of the connection sections does not directly lead to a cut in the current supply for the resistor elements. The data line can preferably comprise separate connection sections.

Within the scope of the invention, it may be provided that a passage element is provided, which extends at least partially through the first carrier element for connecting the sensing means with the decentralized evaluation unit. The passage element may preferably comprise a rivet which is inserted into the first carrier element during the production of the base unit. However, other possibilities of connecting the two base sides of the first carrier element are also conceivable. Preferably, the passage element can be electrically conductive. This can enable the sensing means, which is preferably arranged on the second base side of the first carrier element, to be connected to an electrical component on the opposite, in particular the first base side, of the first carrier element. Thus, on the side of the first carrier element opposite the sensing means, for example, a decentralized evaluation unit can be arranged, which can be electrically coupled to the sensing means through the passage element. In this way, contact can be made through the first carrier element without, for example, laying a line along the outside of the base unit and winding it at least partially around the base unit in order to reach the other side. At the same time, the distance travelled through the passage element can be small, so that the electrical resistance and thus possible signal losses can also be low. The passage element also facilitates simple production, in particular if it is designed as a rivet, for example.

The invention may also provide that the data line comprises a ring section which runs at least partially, preferably completely, circumferentially around a central region of the base unit. Preferably, the data line may comprise a supply section which is at least partially arranged in the central region. The ring section can preferably be understood as a section of the data line which extends along the edge region of the base unit. The ring section can be round or adapted to an angular shape of the sensor mat. The ring section enables a connection of the sensing means to a data connection, even if the sensor mat is cut to size, for example, to adapt to a geometry of a room. In particular, the supply sections connect the ring section with the sensing means and/or the decentralized evaluation units, which are preferably arranged in the central region of the base unit.

Advantageously, the data line can be connected to a data connection that is accessible from outside the base unit. Preferably, the data line can be connected to the central control apparatus through the data connection. Thus, the data connection can ensure that the sensing means and/or the decentralized evaluation unit can be connected to the central control apparatus. This can be done indirectly, for example, by connecting a plurality of sensor mats to each other via different data connections and finally connecting at least one of the sensor mats to the central control apparatus.

Preferably, with a sensor mat according to the invention, the data line can be connected via the ring section to a plurality of data connections, which are arranged in an edge region of the base unit. In particular, the data connections can be part of electrical connections in the edge region of the base unit. The fact that the data line is connected via the ring section to a plurality of data connections further facilitates the possibility of cutting the sensor mat to size. In particular, this means that regions in which a connection is provided can also be cut off without significantly impairing the functionality of the sensing means. Thus, for example, it may only be necessary to leave one data connection if the sensor mat is adapted to a geometry of the room by cutting.

In the case of a sensor mat according to the invention, it is also conceivable that the electrical heating means and/or the conductor track and/or the data line and/or the sensing means comprises a noble metal, in particular silver. It is thus conceivable, for example, that a heating conductor element of the electrical heating means and/or a sensor element of the sensing means comprises the noble metal, in particular silver. A low resistance of the respective component can be ensured by the noble metal, so that the electrical power is not or at least reduced unintentionally, emitted in the form of heat. In particular in the region of the sensing means, a measurement result of the detection of the event can also be improved in its accuracy and/or reliability. Furthermore, for example a silver can be processed in a simple way in a printing method, so that a simple production of the sensor mat can be improved, for example by printing individual components.

It is further conceivable that a sensor mat according to the invention comprises at least one nominal cutting line, along which it is possible to cut the sensor mat for adaptation to a geometry of the room without completely destroying the function of the heating means and/or the sensing means, in particular wherein a part of the heating means and/or sensing means can be separated along the nominal cutting line during cutting. By the nominal cutting line can be understood a region, along which an advantageous cutting possibility is created so that the function of the heating means and/or the sensing means is not completely destroyed. Preferably, the nominal cutting line can be pre-drawn and/or pre-perforated so that an installer can quickly identify the nominal cutting line. In particular, a plurality of nominal cutting lines can be provided. This can further increase the flexibility in the installation of the sensor mat. Furthermore, the nominal cutting lines can result, for example, from the arrangement of the sensor elements of the sensing means and/or the resistor elements of the heating means, in particular if the sensor elements and/or the resistor elements are arranged in a regular pattern.

According to another aspect of the invention, a surface sensor system is claimed for detecting an event in a room of a building. At least one sensor mat according to the invention is laid flat on a structural element of the building.

Thus, an inventive surface sensor system comprises the same advantages as those already described in detail with regard to an inventive sensor mat. The structural element of the building can preferably be understood as a carcass component, in particular a carcass floor. For example, it is conceivable that the sensor mat according to the invention is placed on the structural element and then covered with a functional and/or visual cover of the floor to be produced. In particular, the surface heating system may comprise a plurality of inventive sensor mats which are connected to each other. The surface sensor system can also be designed as a floor sensor system. In this case, the surface sensor system can be laid in a simple manner and at the same time, with only a small thickness, it can also take up a correspondingly small amount of installation space within the building, so that other components of the building are not or only slightly influenced by the sensor mat or the surface sensor system. Preferably, the surface sensor system can also comprise a central control apparatus through which the sensor mat and/or the sensor mats can be controlled. The central control apparatus can be arranged in a flush-mounted box, for example.

According to a further aspect of the invention, a method for producing a sensor mat, preferably a sensor mat according to the invention, is claimed for a surface sensor system, preferably for monitoring a room of a building. In particular, the surface sensor system may be a surface sensor system according to the invention. The method for producing the sensor mat further comprises the following steps:Providing a first carrier element, which comprises a flat extension with a first base side and a second base side,Constructing a flexible base unit, wherein an application of a sensing means for detecting an event on the second base side of the first carrier element is carried out, so that at least the base unit can be laid flat for the design of the surface sensor system.

Preferably, the surface sensor system can be an inventive surface sensor system. In particular, the method according to the invention thus comprises the same advantages as those already described in detail with regard to a sensor mat according to the invention. The provision of the first carrier element can preferably involve the production of a film, in particular a PET film. When applying the sensing means on the second base side, the sensing means can preferably be arranged directly on the second base side of the first carrier element or indirectly on the second base side of the first carrier element. Preferably, the application of the sensing means on the second base side of the first carrier element can establish a firmly-bonded connection of the sensing means with the first carrier element. However, it is also conceivable, that the sensing means is fixed in some other way to the first carrier element or to a further component of the base unit. The event may preferably comprise activity of a person, wherein the activity may for example comprise a stay of the person in the room. In this case, the surface sensor system can be a device or a system suitable for sensing the event or a plurality of events distributed over a surface of the room.

Thus, a sensor mat can be produced in a simple way, which can also be easily installed in a room of a building to design a surface sensor system. For example, the provision of the first carrier element and the construction of the flexible base unit can be carried out at a production site separate from the construction site of the building, while the installation is finally carried out in the room itself, wherein only the sensor mat or a plurality of sensor mats are laid flat.

It is further conceivable that in a method according to the invention, the application of the sensing means comprises the following steps:Applying a sensor material of the sensing means in at least partially liquid form on the second base side of the first carrier element,Curing the sensor material.

Preferably, the sensor material can be applied to the first carrier element by a printing method. In this way, a firmly-bonded connection can be produced in a simple and cost-effective manner. At the same time, the application of the sensor material in at least partially liquid form offers the possibility to produce the sensing means precisely in a reproducible manner.

Furthermore, in the case of a method according to the invention, it is conceivable that the method comprises the following steps:Providing a second carrier element, which comprises a flat extension with a first base side and a second base side,Fixing the first and second carrier element together.

Preferably, the first and second carrier elements can be fixed together in such a way that the first base of the first carrier element and the second base of the second carrier element face each other. The first and second carrier element can be fixed together in a force-locking, form-fit and/or firmly-bonded manner. In this way, the base unit can be created in a simple way. The second carrier element can also provide further protection for the heating means.

Advantageously, in a method according to the invention, it can be provided that the fixing of the first and second carrier elements to each other comprises the arrangement of an intermediate element between the first and second carrier element, in particular wherein an adhesive layer is arranged between the intermediate element and the first carrier element and/or between the intermediate element and the second carrier element. By means of the intermediate element a distance between the carrier elements is achieved in a simple manner. If, for example, a heating means is arranged on the second carrier element and the sensing means is arranged on the first carrier element, mutual interference of the sensing means and the heating means can thereby be reduced. The adhesive layer can be laminated, in particular in the form of a double-sided adhesive tape, to the intermediate element and/or the first and/or second carrier element. This results in an easy fixing possibility of the intermediate element. The intermediate element can advantageously be designed as a sound insulation layer and/or as an adhesive layer itself.

The invention may also provide for the following step to be carried out before the application of the sensing means:Pre-tempering the first and/or second carrier element.

By pre-tempering the first and/or second carrier element, shrinkage during printing of the conductor material can be absorbed. When applying the sensing means, in particular if this is realized by a printing method, the first and/or second carrier element can be heated locally so that thermal stresses occur and at least partially deform the first and/or second carrier element. On cooling, this deformation can finally be reduced, so that damage to the sensing means may occur. This can be counteracted by pre-tempering the first and/or second carrier element.

In the case of a method based on the invention, the construction of the base unit may advantageously comprise the following step:Applying an electrical heating means for emitting heat on the first base side, in particular on the first base side, of the first carrier element and/or on the second carrier element, so that at least the base unit can be laid flat for the design of a surface heating system.

Thus, the functionality of the sensor mat can be supplemented by the functionality of the sensing means. In order to keep the need for electrical insulation to a minimum, the electrical heating means can preferably be arranged on the base side of the first carrier element opposite the sensing means. Additionally or alternatively, the heating means can be arranged on the second carrier element, in particular on a first and/or second base side of the second carrier element.

It is further conceivable within the scope of the invention that the application of the electrical heating means on the first base side of the first carrier element comprises the following steps:Applying a conductor material of the electrical heating means in at least partially liquid form on the first base side of the first and/or second carrier element,Curing the conductor material.

The application of the conductor material may preferably comprise printing of the electrical heating means. In this way, the conductor material can be applied, preferably in atomized form, to the regions to be printed and can create a firmly-bonded connection, in particular with the first and/or second carrier element. The conductor material can be cured preferably by UV radiation or by temperature application. This can accelerate the curing of the conductor material in liquid form. The conductor material can preferably comprise a carbon and/or a filler. The conductor material can be premixed or the carbon and filler can only be mixed when the conductor material is applied. This can facilitate series production of the sensor mat, in particular since the conductor material can be applied in liquid form in a reproducible manner.

The invention may also provide that the construction of the base unit comprises at least one of the following steps:Applying a first protective layer to the electrical heating means, in particular by varnishing, and/orApplying a second protective layer to the sensing means, in particular by varnishing.

Preferably, the electrical heating means and the sensing means can be covered with the first and second protective layer respectively. The first and second protective layer, respectively, may provide electrical insulation so that both the functionality of the electrical heating means and/or the sensing means may be protected against external influences and the environment may be protected against current from the electrical heating means and/or the sensing means. Varnishing can provide an easy way to produce the sensor mat in series production. In particular, this can reduce production costs.

Advantageously, it may be provided that in the case of a method according to the invention, the method further comprises at least one of the following steps:Constructing at least one connecting interface by pressing on a connection means and/or a counter-connection interface by pressing on a counter-connection means, in particular wherein the connection means and the counter-connection means are pressed on simultaneously and/orConstructing a connection interface by cutting a recess, into which a connection unit can be inserted, into the base unit, in particular so that the first and/or second carrier element at least partially limit the recess.

In particular, the connection interface can be a connection interface for reversibly connecting the connection means with a counter-connection means. The connection means can preferably be a push-button, while the counter-connection means can preferably be an eyelet. This makes it easy to create a reversible connection possibility for the sensor mat. In addition or alternatively, the connection interface can be produced, for example, by providing a punching and/or drilling operation through which a contact can be inserted into the base unit and/or exposed on the base unit. In particular, the connection interface can also be formed in that, when the first and/or second protective layer is applied to the electrical heating means or the sensing means, a region of the electrical heating means or the sensing means is covered so that the first or second protective layer does not arise in this region. This means that the electrical heating means or the sensing means can be exposed in this region and thus allow contact. The press tool can preferably be designed to press on both the connection means and the counter-connection means. For this purpose, the press tool can be designed to receive the base unit and can comprise different punches at the respective positions in order to simultaneously press on the counter-connection means and the connection means. Furthermore, contacts for the heating means, the sensing means and/or the decentralized evaluation units can also be pressed on simultaneously with the connection means and the counter-connection means. Preferably, an electrically conductive adhesive may be applied to connect the connection means and/or the counter-connection means to the base unit. To accelerate the adhesion, the electrically conductive adhesive can be cured, e.g. thermally and/or by means of UV radiation. The connection interface can also be used to create a simple receptacle for the connection unit. In recesses where no connection unit is to be attached, a dummy piece can be inserted to protect the connection interface. If the recess is limited by the second, preferably the first, carrier element, a connection means in the form of an electrical contact may be provided on the first and/or second carrier element so that the connection unit can easily be brought into electrical contact with the sensor mat.

The invention may also provide that the method comprises the following steps:Applying an adhesive layer to a sealing layer and/or to a sound insulation layer and/or to the base unit,Fixing the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer to the base unit by the adhesive layer.

The application of the adhesive layer may preferably involve laminating the adhesive layer to the sealing layer or the sound insulation layer or the base unit. Preferably, the adhesive layer can be designed as a double-sided adhesive tape. Thus, the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer can be delivered as prefabricated components and can be easily attached to the base unit by means of the adhesive layer during production of the sensor mat. This can facilitate series production of the sensor mat and/or simplify production. In particular, the production of the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer can be outsourced.

The invention may further provide that the adhesive layer comprises an adhesive tape, the following step being further provided:Scribing the adhesive tape so that two separately usable adhesive regions are produced, wherein a first adhesive region can be used for fixing the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer on the base unit and a second adhesive region can be used for external fixing of the sensor mat.

The adhesive tape can thus simultaneously favor the possibility of connecting the base unit to the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer and two sensor mats, which should be placed next to each other to form the surface heating system. By scribing the adhesive tape, the base unit can first be completely laminated with the adhesive tape and then, depending on the geometry of the room and/or the use of the sensor mat, the adhesive regions can be adapted, in particular to the respective application. The insertion of the adhesive tape can, for example, be carried out at the construction site, while further steps can be carried out in a separate production region of the sensor mat. In particular, however, by scribing the adhesive tape in the separate production environment, a standardized specification may already exist, which can still be changed and/or ignored on the construction site.

Furthermore, in the case of a method involving an invention, the method may comprise the following step:Cutting at least the first and/or second carrier element and/or the intermediate element, in particular wherein the cutting is carried out simultaneously with the pressing on of the connection means and/or the counter-connection means.

In this way, for example, the outer shape of the sensor mat can be specified for series production, in particular before further components are applied to the first and/or second carrier element. Preferably, the complete base unit can be cut to size, in particular preferably together with the sealing layer and/or the sound insulation layer. Thus, for example, a geometry adapted to the application case can be produced, while the upstream production can be carried out, for example, by means of a strip material, in particular as an endless web. It is also conceivable that the cutting of the base unit is carried out in the same press tool as the pressing on of the connection means and the counter-connection means. It is thus conceivable that the outer edge of the press tool is designed as a punching tool and that press punches are provided in the inner region. In this way, different production steps can be combined in a single work step, in particular in a single stroke.

Furthermore, in the case of a method according to the invention, it may be provided that the method further comprises the following step:Arranging at least one decentralized evaluation unit, in particular for processing sensor data of the sensing means, on the base unit, preferably wherein an electrically conductive adhesive is used for an electrical contact between the decentralized evaluation unit and a data line of the base unit.

In particular, the intermediate element can comprise an opening or an opening can be cut into the intermediate element into which the decentralized evaluation unit is inserted. The decentralized evaluation unit can be placed in the center of the base unit. On the one hand, the electrically conductive adhesive can be used to fix the evaluation unit and on the other hand, the electrical contact of the evaluation unit can be realized with the base unit, in particular with connection sections to electrical connections.

The invention may also provide that the method further comprises the following step:Casting a casting compound at least partially via the base unit and/or the decentralized evaluation unit.

The casting compound can preferably be electrically insulating. By at least partially casting the casting compound over the base unit and/or the decentralized evaluation unit, it can be ensured that no undesirable electrical contacts remain open which could impair the functionality of the sensor mat in use. Preferably the casting compound can comprise a synthetic resin or consist of a synthetic resin.

The invention may also provide for a quality control of the heating means. In particular, the quality control of the heating means may comprise the following steps:Placing the sensor mat on a conveyor means, in particular a conveyor belt,Approaching at least one connection interface and/or at least one counter-connection interface with a probe,Testing an electrical parameter, in particular the electrical resistance,Applying a voltage to the heating means and evaluating a thermal image, in particular an infrared image, with regard to a temperature reached,Comparing the electrical parameter and/or the temperature reached with a set-point value.

Furthermore, it is conceivable that a quality control of the sensing means is carried out in the method according to the invention. In particular, the quality control of the sensing means may comprise the following steps:Placing the sensor mat on a conveyor means or conveying the sensor mat on the conveyor means,Approaching at least one sensor element and/or a decentralized evaluation unit with a probe,Positioning a test body on at least one sensor element and storing a sensing signal,Comparing the sensing signal with a reference signal.

Preferably, the conveyor means of the quality control of the sensing means and the heating means may be the same conveyor means, so that the quality control, in particular the complete quality control, can be carried out on the same conveyor means. Quality control can increase the reliability of the method for producing the sensor mat, so that defective products can be identified and sorted out before installation on the construction site.

The disclosure relates to wireless communication technologies, and in particular to a method for sending control information, a method for detecting control information, a base station, a terminal, and a computer storage medium.

BACKGROUND

In a wireless communication system, the link reliability of a physical layer is a very important issue. A deterioration in physical link quality may cause different levels of system performance degradation. In general, a transmission success rate, at the physical layer, of a link at the level of a data channel should be guaranteed at about 90%. For example, when calculating and reporting a Channel Quality Indication (CQI), an appropriate modulation and coding scheme is selected according to a target block error rate about 0.9. If a data block is not correctly transmitted during the actual transmission, a terminal needs to feed back NACK to a base station, and the base station performs retransmission according to the feedback of the terminal, and may initiate multiple retransmissions for the data block that is not correctly transmitted, so as to improve the final success rate of the data block. In addition to a physical layer retransmission technology, it is also possible to initiate retransmission of a larger data block on a high layer. For a control channel, the link reliability requirements are very high, and physical control information generally has no retransmission mechanism. The one-time transmission accuracy rate of the physical control information generally needs to reach 99%, and the transmission success rate of some pieces of more important control information reaches 99.9% or even higher, so as to avoid severe degrading of some system performances caused by the loss of control information, for example, indication information of a physical control channel symbols carried by a Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH).

In a low-frequency system, such as a fourth generation (4G) Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, a multi-antenna closed-loop beamforming technology may be commonly used in data channels to obtain high transmission throughput. However, the characteristic of the beamforming technology is that energy is very concentrated in space. Although the performance is very good when the beam direction is accurate, the performance is degraded once the beam direction is inaccurate. In particular, a beam formed in a large-scale antenna system is very narrow. Although high gain is obtained when beams with very concentrated energy aligned, the performance will be severely degraded when the beam is slightly deviated, and even a signal may not be received completely. The data channel is characterized by emphasis on transmission efficiency and bad robustness. However, since a control channel performs some adjustments for dynamically indicating a data channel transmission policy, adjustment to a wide beam or beam switching may be quickly performed in this case, so that it does not cause particularly serious impact. Further, the target block error rate of the data channel itself is not very demanding, and retransmission may also be performed, so there are no serious problems.

For a control channel, in a low-frequency LTE system, a physical control channel generally adopts a relatively robust transmission mechanism, and does not rely on feedback of Channel State Information (CSI). For example, a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) of LTE adopts a diversity transmission scheme, such as, space frequency block coding (SFBC), or a combination of SFBC and frequency switch transmit diversity (FSTD), which has high robustness and low-order modulation coding, thereby further ensuring high robustness. Therefore, the low-frequency system may work well, there is no frequent problem that a communication link is suddenly broken, and control information and data information cannot be parsed at all.

However, as the number of antennas increases, the coverage of data channel can be greatly enhanced due to the use of Beamforming. However, for the control channel, since the robustness is guaranteed by using a wide beam or a diversity technology (such as SFBC), there is a clear problem of coverage asymmetry. In order to solve this problem, a very low code rate may be required for control channel transmission, which means lower control information transmission efficiency. For a high-frequency system, this problem will be very obvious because the high-frequency coverage is originally a big problem, which needs to use the Beamforming gain of large-scale antennas to resist a large path loss. Therefore, the control channel also considers beamforming transmission through a certain width of beam using channel state information, which means that the control channel also needs to support a closed-loop Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transmission technology.

If the control channel supports MIMO transmission, resource utilization efficiency and coverage will be significantly improved, but the robustness of a link will be difficult to guarantee. In the low-frequency LTE system, if there is a problem with the data link, the control channel is generally robust. The data link may be restored by making some adjustments to the data transmission through the control channel. However, if the control channel also uses MIMO transmission, once the beam is not aligned, e.g., in the case where a terminal moves and a line of sight (LOS) path physically blocks a current transmission beam, the overall link breaking will be caused, thereby resulting in the severe degradation of system performance. For example, if the beam cannot be aligned, uplink CSI cannot be correctly fed back, downlink control and data will not be accurate, and an uplink control channel will be lost. In this case, uplink and downlink data and control links will be broken, and link restoration and reconstruction cannot be quickly performed. The case where the beam cannot be aligned or blocked may be as illustrated inFIG.1.

In a high-frequency system, when large-scale antennas are applied, an MIMO technology is used for both control and data channels in the related art, so the problem described above is always existed. Once the beam cannot be aligned or blocked, downlink control, downlink data, uplink control and uplink data are all broken. If there is downlink data to be sent at this time, the terminal does not receive control information and even cannot receive data, and no feedback is given. The terminal may understand that there is no information to be sent. In this case, the terminal has been lost from the network, and the terminal is not even aware of the loss of the link. The terminal will mistakenly believe that there is no data transmission on the downlink.

This disclosure relates to the field of content sharing platforms and, in particular, to a handoff feature for content sharing platforms.

BACKGROUND

Content-sharing platforms and their corresponding websites and mobile applications (“apps”) allow users to play and watch music and videos. With increasing availability of different mediums to access services or applications (such as a content sharing platform), requests to these centralized services or applications are originating from a variety of sources. Despite the different access mediums, the underlying reason for using the services remains the same.

SUMMARY

The following is a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosure, nor delineate any scope of the particular implementations of the disclosure or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

In an aspect of the disclosure, a method includes maintaining a session history of a session that occurred at a first client device, the session history identified by a visit identifier (ID) and comprising a set of recently consumed content items on a content sharing platform, determining that a user associated with the session is active on a second client device, transmitting, to the second client device, a session continuation notification associated with the visit ID and a navigation end-point of the session, receiving, from the second client device, a request for a content item corresponding to the navigation end-point of the session, and transmitting, to the second client device, instructions to the content item and to request additional components of the watch page UI using the visit ID, the additional components comprising recommended content items to consume next that are identified based on the set of recently consumed content items associated with the visit ID.

In one implementation, the navigation end-point may include an identifier of a last consumed content item on the first client device and a timestamp comprising a location within the last viewed content item corresponding to a stopping point of the session at the first client device. Furthermore, the visit ID may be different than a session ID, where the visit ID is associated with content sharing platform events associated with the first client device and corresponding to the user, and where occurrences of the content sharing platform events are separated by less than a determined time interval. In addition, the session ID may be associated with the content sharing platform events that occur within a single day on the first client device. In addition, maintaining the session history for each event of the session includes logging a visit ID that is different than the session ID, the visit ID associated with content sharing platform events associated with the first client device and corresponding to the user.

In some implementations, the method further includes receiving an indication of a user selection of a handoff feature from the first client device during the session occurring at the first client device and, responsive to receiving the indication, identifying one or more client devices comprising at least the second client device as associated with the user, generating the session continuation notification responsive to receiving the indication, and transmitting the session continuation notification to the identified one or more client devices.

BACKGROUND

Technical Field

The present disclosure relates to a coil component.

Background Art

There is a known coil component described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2015-65272. This coil component includes a core, a plate member, and a wire winding on the core, and an adhesive is disposed between the wire and the plate member to fix the core to the plate member.

SUMMARY

However, when an adhesive is disposed on a wire as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2015-65272, an adhesive area cannot be reserved, thus having sometimes lowered fixation between a core and a plate member.

Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a coil component that has increased fixation between a core and a plate member, low magnetic resistance, and good product characteristics.

A coil component according to preferred embodiments of the present disclosure includes a core having a winding core portion, a first flange portion disposed on a first end portion of the winding core portion, and a second flange portion disposed on a second end portion of the winding core portion; and a wire winding on the winding core portion of the core; a plate member disposed so as to bridge the first flange portion and the second flange portion.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Proteins and other biological molecules suffer degradation when exposed to pH and thermal stresses due to denaturation, aggregation and other adverse chemical and physical modifications (Chang et al. 2010; Ueda et al. 2001). Such pH and thermal stresses can occur during processing, formulation or storage of biological molecules. For biological molecules having therapeutic applications, degradation results in lower yield and loss of activity.

Physical stresses such as heating or freeze drying can result in loss of native structure and thus activity of biological molecules. Chemical stresses such as low or high pH also degrade the structure of biological molecules, resulting aggregation, misfolding or precipitation of the biological molecules (Chang et al. 2010). For therapeutic biological molecules, some formulations require low or high pH for specific drug release needs, but such pH conditions can also adversely effect stability and thus shelf life of the therapeutic molecule. Stabilization of biological molecules is particularly important when the biological molecules have therapeutic activity so that said activity does not diminish over time.

Certain carbohydrates have been shown to stabilize biological molecules exposed to adverse temperatures and other stresses (Ueda et al. 2001; Kaushik et al. 2003; Singer at al. 1998; Lin et al. 1996; Jain et al. 2009; Andya et al. 2003; and Khan et al. 2010). One example is Trehalose, which is a disaccharide of glucose, linked by an alpha,alpha-1,1-glycosidic bond, that accumulates in many organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, plants and insects which withstand extended periods of dessication and inanimation. In several bacteria, trehalose is synthesised as a response to osmotic stress (Reed et al. 1986).

Trehalose has been used as an excipient in several biopharmaceuticals such as Avastin, Herceptin, Lucentis and Rituxan. (Ohtak et al. 2011). Addition of trehalose to several proteins and recombinant proteins increases their stability, as can be seen by the increase of their melting temperatures (Tm) (Kaushik et al. 2003; Lin et al. 1996; Singer et al. 1998; Ueda et al. 2001). One theory for the thermal stabilizing effect of trehalose is that when trehalose is added to a solution of protein it increases the surface tension of the medium leading to greater preferential hydration of the protein and thus increasing protein stability against degradation. Such compounds can be understood to shift equilibrium toward natively-folded conformations by raising the free energy of the unfolded state (Khan et al. 2010; Rajan et al. 2011).

Trehalose and saccharose have been studied as stabilizers in freeze-dried formulations of a recombinant monoclonal antibodies. (Andya et al. 2003) One theory for the stabilizing effect of trehalose in dried formulations is that the trehalose interacts with the protein surface and serves as a water substitute which maintains structure of the biological molecule while resisting chemical and physical modification (Kaushik et al. 2003). Saccharose has also been shown to stabilize proteins from thermal degradation (Lee et al. 1981). Poly-amido-saccharides (PASs) have been shown to stabilize lysozyme toward dehydration and freezing stresses (Stidham et al. 2014).

Stabilization of biological molecules under pH stress remains a challenge. A particular challenge is stabilization of biological molecules under combined thermal and pH stress. New stabilisers are need which prevent degradation of biological molecules at low pH or high pH including when thermal stress is present.

"
11933039	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to structures for mounting and aligning panels to prefabricated building modules and other building structures.

BACKGROUND

Curtain wall systems are commonly used for high rise buildings. A curtain wall is a non-load bearing facade that is attached to the outside of the building. Curtain walls are generally comprised of panels that are separately mounted to the building structure. The panels can have various designs and may have a solid surface or include window components. Various mounting hardware exists for hanging the panels from the load bearing building structure and transferring the load of the panel to the load bearing building structure, such as the floors or other structural framing.

Curtain wall systems must perform various functions, including providing an air, water and thermal barrier. To achieve this, the fit between adjacent panels must be very accurate, often with a tolerance on the order of 1 mm. When mounting panels on-site to an existing building structure, workers manually lower each panel into place, coupling it to the building via panel mounting hardware. Components in the conventional panel mounting hardware on the building, on the panel, or in between, can typically be adjusted during installation to shift the position of the panel as needed.

Buildings can also be constructed using pre-fabricated modules that are assembled at remote locations and then delivered to the building job site where they are then lifted and stacked together. The more of the module that is assembled remotely, the less work is required at the building site. Accordingly, it is desirable for the surfaces of modules that will face outwards on the final building to have the facade panels attached before the modules are delivered.

Conventional panel mounting hardware used in non-modular buildings is not well suited for pre-mounting panels to a module. The conventional panel mount hardware design is made with the assumption that panels are first mounted to a building very near to their final position on the building. Such conventional mounting hardware is not configured to handle the very wide range and directions of stresses that can be applied to a panel pre-mounted to a module as the module is swung and lifted in place on a building.

In addition, to limit the total number of interfaces between panels, the panels used in pre-fab building modules are generally much wider and heavier than standard panels and can weigh 1.5 tons or more. Conventional mounting hardware adjustment mechanisms used to tweak panel position during installation typically include slotted parts. When used with a very heavy panel, the friction between the movable parts bearing the weight of the panel can make adjustment difficult or impossible.

An improved facade panel mounting system is needed that addresses these deficiencies. It is further desirable if the panel mounting system will allow a pre-mounted panel to automatically adjust its position as the module is lowered in place so that once the module is fully seated, the panel is properly aligned to a very small tolerance and all that remains to be done on site is to lock the movable components of the panel mounting system in place.

SUMMARY

These and other objects and advantages are provided by a mounting system for building panels which can include a mounting bracket for affixing a building panel to building support structure, such as a prefabricated module, and which bracket allows the position of the panel on the module to be adjusted during panel and module installation at a building side within a relatively wide range of positions. Mullion guides on the sides of the panel automatically adjust a panel position as the panel is lowered in place from a first relatively large horizontal placement tolerance of the module to a smaller horizontal placement tolerance, such as needed for other interacting structures on adjacent sides of installed panels. After the panel is installed, mullion guides on the adjacent panel sides can be removed. The bracket and mullion guides can be used separately or in combination on a prefabricated module with pre-attached panel or in other applications.

According to an embodiment, a mounting system or bracket for attaching a building panel to a building support structure comprises a fixed lower component that can be rigidly connected to a building support structure and a movable upper component that has a panel coupler on it and from which a panel can be hung. A bottom surface of the upper component is spaced apart from an opposing top surface of the lower component and at least part of a bearing assembly, such as a ball bearing, is positioned in the gap between the surfaces. When a panel is mounted, the panel load is transferred, at least in part, from the moving component to the fixed component through the bearing assembly allowing the upper component to move horizontally relative to the lower component with low friction.

A vertical bolt, rod, pin can be fixed to one component and pass through an oversized hole in the other component. For example, a bolt can pass through a hole in the upper component and threadedly engage the lower component. Interaction between the bolt and the periphery of the hole constrain horizontal motion of the upper component relative to the lower component to a predefined amount. The maximum amount of horizontal motion can be selected to be the maximum initial horizontal displacement of the panel relative to its desired position next to an adjacent panel during installation based on expected part and installation tolerances.

In one embodiment, the mounting bracket can be attached to a building support structure and is used to support a panel. The bracket comprises a lower bearing support with a rear portion connectable to a building support, such as by a vertical plate which can be bolted to the building support structure. An upward facing bearing assembly is mounted in the lower bearing support. An upper bearing support with a rear portion is also connected to the vertical support and a downward facing bearing assembly is mounted therein. The downward facing bearing assembly is closer to the vertical support than the upward facing bearing assembly. An anchor plate is positioned between the first bearing support and the second bearing support so that the bottom surface of the anchor plate is in contact with the upward facing bearing assembly and the top surface of the anchor plate is in contact with the downward facing bearing assembly.

A panel coupler is provided to allow the panel to be mounted to and hang from the anchor plate. The anchor plate is supported between the upward facing bearing assembly and the downward facing bearing assembly. The panel load is transferred through the anchor plate and bearing supports to the building support structure. The bearing structures allow the horizontal position of the anchor plate to be easily adjusted even when supporting the full weight of a mounted panel. In an embodiment, two upward facing bearing assemblies are used with a single downward facing bearing positioned laterally between them.

A bolt passing through a large aperture in the anchor plate and engaging a portion of the lower bearing support can be provided to constrain horizontal motion of the anchor plate relative to the lower bearing support to a predefined amount. This amount can be selected to be the maximum initial horizontal displacement of the panel relative to its desired position next to an adjacent panel during installation based on expected part and installation tolerances.

The anchor plate can be locked in a default position, e.g., for transport, by passing a locking bolt through a first locking aperture in the anchor plate and into an aligned locking aperture in the locking block portion of the lower bearing support. The locking pin can be removed before installation. The anchor plate and thereby a panel mounted to the bracket can be locked in position after installation by means of a set screw or bolt engaging a separate second locking aperture and screwed down onto the surface of the lower bearing support.

Another embodiment of the mounting bracket comprises a horizontal support plate configured to be rigidly connected to building support structures at a rear portion of the support plate. A bearing support has a downward facing bearing assembly mounted therein and is positioned above the support plate. The rolling portion of the bearing engages the top surface of the support plate. The front of the bearing support includes a panel coupler from which a panel can be hung. The panel coupler can comprise a vertical track into which a vertical member extending from the panel can be fitted or can be another support structure.

Horizontal flange portions extend laterally from opposite sides of the bearing support and extend over support plate. Each flange has aperture therein. A bolt extends downward the aperture and engages the support plate beneath. The aperture has a diameter substantially greater than the diameter of the bolt. The amount of horizontal motion of the bearing support relative to the support plate is constrained by the interaction of the bolts with the inner peripheries of the apertures. The amount of horizontal motion available can be selected to be the maximum initial horizontal displacement of the panel relative to its desired position next to an adjacent panel during installation based on expected part and installation tolerances.

The head of the bolt is larger than the aperture or the bolt can be fitted a washer larger than the aperture and that is placed over the aperture. The head of the bolt, directly or via the washer, limits the amount the respective flange portion can move upwards away from the support plate and thereby the amount the bearing support can tilt relative to the support plate. The amount of tilt available can be small enough that the flange portions will not contact the support plate at when the bearing support is at maximum tilt. In one configuration, the bolts can be installed so that the washers are loosely held between the top of the respective flanges and the bottom of the bolt heads. This loose connection allows horizontal motion of the bearing support relative to the support plate while allowing only minimal vertical motion.

When a panel is mounted to the panel coupler the load from the panel is transferred from the bearing support through the bearing to the support plate. The bearing support can be locked in a default position, e.g., for transport, relative to the support plate by use of a locking pin. The locking pin can be removed before installation. According to a further embodiment, a prefabricated building module is provided. The building module comprises a chassis and a plurality of mounting brackets, as above attached to a support beam at a top of an outer wall of the module chassis. A panel is mounted to the brackets via the panel coupler. The prefabricated module with attached panel can then be shipped to a building site for subsequent installation in a building. An elastic spacer assembly can be positioned between the panel and the chassis towards the bottom of the panel to limit motion of the panel relative to the module, e.g., when the module with panel is lifted and swung into place at a building site. The spacer assembly can comprise a compression spring, a tension spring, and a distance limiter.

When a pre-fabricated module with an attached panel is lifted for installation its initial horizontal placement relative to a previously placed module and panel may only be accurate to within a tolerance that is much looser than that required for the adjacent sides of the panels themselves. According to a further aspect of the invention a panel alignment system is provided comprising mullion guides mounted to the left and right sides of a panel. The mullion guides on adjacent sides of a placed panel and a panel being lowered interact to adjust the horizontal position of the side of the panel being placed as it is lowered into position.

In an embodiment, a first mullion guide is attached to a first panel side, such as the right side. A second mullion guide is attached to the second panel side, such as the left side of a panel to be installed. In practice a single panel can be provided with both mullion guides installed and where each of the first and second mullion guides on that panel will interact with the opposing second and first mullion guides on adjacent sides of adjacent left and right panels.

The first mullion guide comprises a first alignment structure formed near its top. The first alignment structure defines a first axial channel that extends along at least part of the panel side and widens at its top. The second mullion guide has a second alignment structure formed near its bottom. The second alignment structure defines a second axial channel that that extends along at least part of the panel side and widens at its bottom.

The first alignment structure is configured to capture at least a portion of the bottom end of the second mullion guide in the first axial channel during an installation of the second panel next to the first panel when the bottom end of the second mullion is positioned above the top of the first mullion guide within the designed horizontal tolerance range. As the second panel is lowered, the first alignment structure adjusts the horizontal position of the second mullion guide in one direction, such as front-to-back. At the same time, the second alignment structure is configured to capture at least a portion of the top end of the bottom mullion guide in the second axial channel and adjust the horizontal position of the second mullion guide in a second direction, such as left-to-right.

In an embodiment, the first mullion guide comprises a respective base that is mounted to the first side of the first panel. First and second side walls extend outwards from the base, and a pair of opposing axial flanges extending inwards from the side walls and defining the first axial channel. The second mullion guide comprises a respective base that is mounted to the second side of the panel and an axial wall extending away from the base. The axial wall extends along at least part of the panel side. One or more guide blocks are mounted to one side of the axial wall near its bottom defining the second axial channel.

In operation, as the panel is lowered, the first axial channel will capture the axial wall on the second mullion guide and funnel the leading edge of axial wall into the main part of the first axial channel, moving the second mullion guide it front-to-back as needed. Generally (although not necessary) at the same time the second axial channel will capture one of the flanges at the top of the first mullion guide and the interaction of the captured flange with the boundary of the second channel moves the second mullion left-to-right as needed. Another ‘second axial channel’ can be formed on the other side of the axial wall so that both flanges of the first mullion guide are captured.

In an embodiment, the first mullion guide can extend above the top of the panel and the alignment structures on the first and second mullion guides positioned so that as a panel is lowered in place, the alignment structures operate to align the side wall of the panel being lowered before other structures on the adjacent sides of the panels that require a tight placement tolerance start to interact.

According to a further embodiment, the mullion guides can be slidably and removably mounted in tracks attached to the sides of the panels. The bottom position of each mullion guide in the track can be fixed by a stop in the track, such as a set screw. The top of each mullion can be temporarily attached to the respective panel with a locking screw. After the panel is installed, the locking screws can be removed and the mullion guides lifted out from between the adjacent sides of the panel.

In addition to mullion guides, the panel can further have an alignment pin extending upwards from the top of the panel and an alignment aperture in the bottom of the panel. The alignment pin and aperture help align the free side of a panel being installed (e.g., the side not aligned by the interacting mullion guides) with a panel underneath.

Embodiments presented herein relate to a method, a wireless radio transceiver device, a computer program, and a computer program product for configuring beamforming settings.

BACKGROUND

In communications networks, there may be a challenge to obtain good performance and capacity for a given communications protocol, its parameters and the physical environment in which the communications network is deployed.

For example, for future generations of mobile communications systems frequency bands at many different carrier frequencies could be needed. For example, low such frequency bands could be needed to achieve sufficient network coverage for wireless radio transceiver devices and higher frequency bands (e.g. at millimeter wavelengths (mmW), i.e. near and above 30 GHz) could be needed to reach required network capacity. In general terms, at high frequencies the propagation properties of the radio channel are more challenging and beamforming both at the access node of the network and at the wireless radio transceiver devices might be required to reach a sufficient link budget.

The wireless radio transceiver devices could implement beamforming by means of analog beamforming, digital beamforming, or hybrid beamforming. Each implementation has its advantages and disadvantages. A digital beamforming implementation is the most flexible implementation of the three but also the costliest due to the large number of required radio chains and baseband chains. An analog beamforming implementation is the least flexible but cheaper to manufacture due to a reduced number of radio chains and baseband chains compared to the digital beamforming implementation. A hybrid beamforming implementation is a compromise between the analog and the digital beamforming implementations. As the skilled person understands, depending on cost and performance requirements of different wireless radio transceiver devices, different implementations will be needed.

When the wireless radio transceiver devices uses analog beamforming it could be challenging for the wireless radio transceiver devices to determine if a currently used beam produced by using the analog beamforming is a good beam in terms of a given signal quality criterion or if there exist other beams that if generated by the analog beamforming would perform significantly better in terms of the given signal quality criterion. In order to evaluate if any other such beam is better a beam finding procedures, for example using beam reference signals (BRS), could be used. However, performing such a procedure typically requires comparatively much overhead signaling between the access node and the wireless radio transceiver device which, thus, will temporarily occupy radio resources and increase the average interference in the network.

Hence, there is a need for an improved beam finding procedure.

BACKGROUND

The invention concerns a method and a system for monitoring of work at a specific location in a facility. The invention is related, in particular, to monitoring a course of work where a risk of fire exists—so called pre-fire monitoring.

European patent publication EP0155032 discloses a device for monitoring of presence of an individual within a pre-defined area and a method of use of such a device, in which the monitored individual wears an electromagnetic wave transmitter provided with a battery and a clock device activating the transmitter after a specified time.

American patent publication U.S. Pat. No. 8,810,392 discloses a device and a method for monitoring presence of items and generating alarms if absence is detected. In this method, the context of user is specified and utilized to determine a proximity framework between the monitoring device and one or more items. The proximity framework includes one or more proximity requirements between the monitoring device and an item, as well as a notification process corresponding to this proximity requirement. Then, proximity of the item and of the monitoring device is monitored on the basis of a signal from a radio transmitter placed on the item, in order to determine whether proximity criteria are met. The relevant notification process is initiated if proximity requirements are not met.

Publication of international patent application WO2017030799 discloses a device for monitoring presence of people within a ticket control area and granting access to authorised individuals. A mobile device receives a radio signal from a beacon in Bluetooth standard. This signal is used to determine whether the device is located within the ticket control area and the respective signal is sent to an external unit, also using the Bluetooth interface. This signal is used to determine whether user holds a valid ticket and opens (or does not open) a gate. This solution ensures higher throughput of ticket control systems. Publication of US patent application no US2018108236 discloses a method and system for monitoring course of work at a specified location of work including at least one radio beacon and a mobile device connected to a server using a communication network. The system is adapted to send message that includes context data to a personal protection equipment management system PPEMS and to monitor location of the worker and generate alarm according to safety rules.

Work with potential risk of fire, executed at industrial facilities by external contractors, are subjected to strict monitoring. Work permit circulation and supervision harmonisation thereof usually use the traditional, paper-based form. An example set of data required to issue a work permit is presented inFIG.1. It includes: identity of the person performing the work, identity of the person monitoring (fire watch) the work, date, identifier of work (job number), location of work, scope and time of work, date and time at which the work is started.

No automated solution is available in the field, which would minimise the risk of an accident related to execution of work by external contractors and internal organisation units, in addition to access monitoring and granting.

SUMMARY

12017802	"TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD

This invention relates to a debris collecting apparatus, and more specifically a debris collecting apparatus configured to attract, ensnare, and guide orbital debris positioned in a low Earth orbit (LEO), and a related method. The invention further relates to a debris collecting apparatus configured to alter the orbit of orbital debris in LEO in order to cause the orbital debris to enter Earth's atmosphere.

BACKGROUND

Space junk or orbital debris is material that orbits a celestial body such as Earth. Earth's orbital debris is primarily the result of artificial objects left in space and the collisions between such artificial objects. There are about 6,000 tons of orbital debris orbiting Earth comprising millions of objects that vary in size from tiny flecks of paint to large booster rockets. The orbital debris generally enters low Earth orbit (LEO), being located at an altitude of approximately 2,000 km or less. The orbital debris can orbit very fast and may reach speeds of 18,000 mi/hr. Over 500,000 pieces of orbital debris are tracked by NASA and the Department of Defense.FIG.1illustrates a representation of pieces of orbital debris50(indicated by individual dots) positioned around the Earth10. (https://www.nasa.gov/sitesidefaultfilesistyles/ubernode_alt_horiz/public/4-8-nrc-evaluates-nasas-orbital-debris-programs.jpg). It can be clearly seen that the majority of the orbital debris50is positioned in the LEO20. The tracking information is used to calculate safe passage of spacecraft traveling to and from Earth and the positioning of satellites to orbit Earth. For example, NASA has a set of long-standing guidelines that are used to assess whether the threat of a close pass of orbital debris is sufficient to warrant evasive action or other precautions to ensure the safety of the crew of the International Space Station (ISS). When predictions indicate that the orbital debris will pass close enough for concern and the quality of the tracking data is deemed sufficiently accurate, mission control centers in Houston and Moscow work together to develop a prudent course of action.

However, not every piece of orbital debris can be tracked and untracked orbital debris threatens the safety of future space missions and satellite longevity. Many spacecrafts, the ISS, and some satellites even have debris shields to help protect from orbital debris. Currently, there are no laws governing the clean-up of orbital debris and the sheer scale of the problem along with the complications of a space operation will make any clean-up dangerous and expensive. As the orbital debris orbits the planet in LEO, it also may separately spin or rotate. This additional rotation makes it especially challenging and dangerous to capture orbital debris. Some have proposed a device that ensnares orbital debris using a net, however trying to ensnare a rotating piece of debris using a net can cause the net to tangle and/or rip. Moreover, the forces of the rotating debris, once captured, can be transferred to the device thereby causing it to be deflected from its orbit. In addition, some pieces of space debris are relatively fragile and contact/physical manipulation using a net may break a single piece of debris into multiple pieces of debris. Other proposed methods face similar challenges.

These are just some of the problems associated with devices and methods used to clean up orbital debris.

SUMMARY

An embodiment of a method for collecting orbital debris using the debris collecting apparatus may comprise detecting a piece of orbital debris approaching the front end of the debris collecting apparatus. The detection step may performed using the one or more sensors, cameras, and processors onboard the debris collecting apparatus in cooperation with each other. Bidirectional communication with a remote server or control device on Earth's surface may enable outside intervention and control of one or more components of the debris collecting apparatus. A plurality of collecting extensions are extended or opened to enable access to the collecting zone and an electromagnet is activated when the detected distance of the debris reaches a predetermined value. The strength of the electromagnet is adjusted depending on the distance from the orbital debris and the size of the orbital debris in order to slow or stop rotation of the orbital debris and to attract the orbital debris to the collecting zone. The electromagnet is deactivated once the rotation of the orbital debris has stopped and the orbital debris is positioned in the collecting zone. The plurality of collecting extensions are articulated such that contact elements of the collecting extensions are in contact with and secure the orbital debris. The orbit of the debris collecting apparatus is changed to a decaying orbit to move the debris collecting apparatus out of LEO and closer to Earth. The debris collecting apparatus remains in the decaying orbit until a predetermined altitude is reached at which point the orbital debris is released to continue along the decaying orbit such that it enters Earth's atmosphere. The debris collecting apparatus is then moved out of the decaying orbit and returns to a stable LEO.

Another embodiment of a method for collecting orbital debris using a debris collecting apparatus comprises detecting a piece of orbital debris approaching a front end of the debris collecting apparatus and enabling access to a collecting zone. An electromagnet is activated when the detected distance reaches a predetermined value. The strength of the electromagnet is controlled depending on the size of the debris and the distance of the debris from the electromagnet, wherein the electromagnet acts to slow or stop rotation of the orbital debris and to attract the orbital debris to the collecting zone. The electromagnet is deactivated once the rotation of the orbital debris has stopped and the orbital debris is positioned in the collecting zone. The orbital debris is secured and the orbit of the debris collecting apparatus is changed to a decaying orbit in order to move the debris collecting apparatus out of LEO and closer to Earth. The debris collecting apparatus remains in the decaying orbit until a predetermined altitude is reached at which point the orbital debris is released from the collecting zone to continue along the decaying orbit such that it enters Earth's atmosphere. The debris collecting apparatus is then moved out of the decaying orbit and returned to a stable LEO.

In an embodiment, the step of detecting of the piece of orbital debris is done using one or more sensors and cameras, wherein the one or more sensors and cameras are configured to communicate with at least one processor. In an embodiment, the at least one processor is configured for bidirectional communication with a control unit or server on Earth's surface to enable control of one or more components of the debris collecting apparatus from Earth. In an embodiment, the step of securing the orbital debris comprises contacting the orbital debris with one or more collecting extensions. In an embodiment, after releasing the orbital debris, the debris collecting apparatus returns to LEO at a predetermined position.

An embodiment of a debris collecting apparatus comprises a body extending along a body axis from a first end to an opposing second end and a propulsion source configured to propel the body. A collecting device is positioned at the first end and comprises an electromagnet and a plurality of extensions positioned around the electromagnet, wherein each of the plurality of extensions is configured to move relative to each other and the body. The debris collecting apparatus further includes at least one rechargeable power source in electrical communication with each of the plurality of extensions and the electromagnet and at least one solar array coupled to the body and comprising a plurality of solar panels, wherein the at least one solar array is in electrical communication with the at least one rechargeable power source. The plurality of extensions and the electromagnet at least partially define a collecting zone.

In an embodiment, at least one of the plurality of extensions comprises a dispenser configured to dispense a high-density foam. In an embodiment, at least one sensor is positioned on the body and configured to determine a distance from a piece of orbital debris. In another embodiment, at least two of the plurality of extensions further comprise a contacting element positioned at a distal end of the extension and configured to contact a piece of orbital debris. In an embodiment, the body further comprises a skirt configured to at least partially define the collecting zone. In an embodiment, the electromagnet and the plurality of extensions are configured to cooperate in order to attract and trap a piece of orbital debris within the collecting zone. In another embodiment, the trapped piece of orbital debris is configured to be positioned and released to enter Earth's atmosphere.

Additional features and advantages of the present disclosure are described in, and will be apparent from, the following Brief Description of the Drawings and Detailed Description.

Furthermore, the robot cell can advantageously have quality assurance modules.

According to a very easily installed embodiment of the robot cell according to the invention, the housing thereof has an open side which faces the machine tool or assembly machine.

If the housing of the robot cell has a wall on its first end face adjacent to the open side, which can be pivoted from its closed position into a position aligning with a side wall of the housing opposite the open side, a free movement zone can be created for the manipulator of the robot cell because the first end face of the robot cell is then also open.

In order to create a zone in the work area of the robot cell or of the industrial robot thereof that is protected to a certain degree against entry of persons, it is advantageous if the wall pivotal on the first end face of the housing has on its inside surface a protective bar that can be moved to and from a rest position, in which it contacts the inside surface of the wall, and an operating position, in which it preferably projects roughly perpendicularly from the inside surface of the wall. A work zone that is virtually closed off to the outside, is created by the wall on the first end face of the housing, the protective bar projecting perpendicularly from the inside surface of this wall, and the area of the machine tool or assembly machine opposite the wall aligning with the side wall of the housing.

According to another development of the robot cell according to the invention, the housing thereof is accordingly likewise provided with a wall on its second end face adjacent to the open side, which can be pivoted from its closed position into a position aligning with the side wall of the housing opposite the open side. The work zone for the manipulator of the robot cell can thus be enlarged there as well.

Obviously, a protective bar can also be provided on the inside surface of the wall pivotal on the second end face of the housing, which bar can be pivoted to and from a rest position, in which it contacts the inside surface of the wall, and an operating position, in which it preferably projects roughly perpendicularly from the inside surface of the wall. In like manner, a work zone that is virtually closed off to the outside can also be defined at this end face of the robot cell.

The manipulator or industrial robot of the robot cell is advantageously mounted on a suspension that is in turn mounted on two vertical beams that are on the two side ends of the side wall of the housing. It is thus possible to dispense with continuous vertical components on the open side of the housing, meaning that continuous vertical components obstructing the work zone of the manipulator are not present at the corners of the open side of the housing.

Control cabinets of the robot cell and the controller of the same are advantageously above the manipulator or industrial robot mounted on the suspension such that the movement or work zone of the manipulator or industrial robot is restricted as little as possible by these components.

In order to design the operation of the robot cell on the machine tool or assembly machine to be as safe and trouble-free as possible, it is advantageous if an area scanner is provided on each wall, in the distal end region thereof in the open position relative to the housing, by means of which a safety zone bordered by the respective walls can be scanned and, in the event that foreign bodies enter the safety zone, a trigger signal can be output to the controller of the robot cell in order to slow or stop the movement of the manipulator or industrial robot. Accordingly, the controller of the robot cell then slows or stops the movement of the manipulator as required.

The operation or use of the robot cell can be further simplified if each wall of the robot cell has operating and/or signaling elements that can initiate routine operating processes (for example stop, start, loading of the unmachined parts storage unit, etc.).

In order to design, for example, a transport of the robot cell such that it is as trouble-free as possible, it is advantageous if the walls thereof can be locked in their closed position on the housing or on a frame of the robot cell.

Procedures for transporting the robot cell can be further simplified if at least one handle, for example a bow-type handle that can be used for pushing and pulling the robot cell, is formed on the outer surfaces of each wall.

Advantageously, the housing of the robot cell can be closed on its open side by a suitable cover or the like, for example when transporting the robot cell.

12021895	"FIELD

Aspects described herein generally relate to the field of malware detection; and, specifically to predicting possible security threats using multi-level, ensemble artificial intelligence (AI) with bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and natural language processing (NLP); and then initiating remedial measures accordingly.

BACKGROUND

Information security is an important aspect of the financial and banking sectors. Malware attacks (e.g., phishing attacks, cyberattacks, ransomware) on a company's systems trigger violations that can pave the way to compliance issues and disciplinary actions including monetary penalties and loss of reputation. Several current systems have perimeter layer controls in place that monitor and detect suspicious activity and involves a lot of manual human intervention. In addition, a drawback of these current system is that there is no any proactive measure to warn the user or company's system while an analysis is performed of such suspicious activity. Sometimes a user might not be escalated until after 24 hours or more after the activity. Moreover, all the parameters about the activity might not be captured, thus it is even difficult to drill down more on the violation and create awareness with the users and company.

SUMMARY

Aspects of the disclosure provide solutions that address and overcome technical problems associated with detection of suspicious network activity from an external network communicatively connected via a network server to a private communication network. Disclosed herein is a multi-level, ensemble network monitoring system for malware detection that comprises artificial intelligence (AI) with bidirectional long short-term memory (BDLSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and natural language processing (NLP) to predict possible security threats and then initiate remedial measures such as blocking network communications associated with high-risk user computing devices from accessing a private communication network.

In one example, a multi-level, ensemble network monitoring system is disclosed comprising a high-volume data storage unit, at least one computer processor, a first-level natural language processing (NLP) module, a second-level artificial intelligence (AI) module, and a computer memory. The multi-level, ensemble network monitoring system may perform steps of receiving, from the first-level NLP module, information associated with network activity corresponding to user computing devices, and processing, by the computer processor, the generated vectors detect if the suspicious network activity exists. If the system fails to detect the suspicious network activity, then the second-level AI module predicts, using the generated vectors, whether the network activity is suspicious. The system may send, based on the predicting, an indication to a network server to block communications from accessing the private communication network.

In another example, a recurrent neural network (RNN) system in a multi-level, ensemble network monitoring system is disclosed. The RNN system may comprise historical training data, generated vectors, and a bidirectional long-short term memory (BDLSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), as described herein.

12002948	"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

The present application relates to the field of lithium secondary batteries of high energy density. More particularly, the application relates to a method of preparing carbon-selenium nanocomposite materials and their applications. The present invention also relates to immobilized selenium comprising selenium and carbon. It also relates to a method of making and the utility of the immobilized selenium. One of the uses of the immobilized selenium is in a rechargeable battery. The present invention also relates to a rechargeable battery that can perform discharge-charge cycling at a fast rate (e.g., 10 C-rate) with a minimum level of capacity fading while being able to substantially recover its electrochemical performance, such as specific capacity, when charged at a low rate such as at 0.1 C-rate.

Description of Related Art

With the increasing human demand for energy, secondary batteries with high mass specific energy and high volumetric energy density, such as lithium-sulfur batteries and lithium-selenium batteries, have attracted widespread interests. Group 6A elements in the Periodical Table, such as sulfur and selenium, have shown two-electron reaction mechanisms in the electrochemical reaction process with lithium. Despite the theoretical mass specific capacity of selenium (675 mAh/g) being lower than that of sulfur (1675 mAh/g), selenium has a higher density (4.82 g/cm3) than sulfur (2.07 g/cm3). Therefore the theoretical volumetric energy density of selenium (3253 mAh/cm3) is close to the theoretical volumetric energy density of sulfur (3467 mAh/cm3). At the same time, as compared with sulfur, which is close to an electrically insulating material, selenium is semi-conductive electrically and shows better electrical conductive properties. Therefore, as compared to sulfur, selenium can demonstrate a higher level of activity and better utilization efficiency even at a higher loading level, leading to high energy and power density battery systems. Moreover, a selenium-carbon composite can have a further improvement in the electrical conductivity over sulfur-carbon composite to obtain a higher activity electrode material.

As described in patent publication no. CN104393304A, by passing hydrogen selenide gas through a graphene dispersion solution, the solvent heat reduces the graphene oxide into graphene while oxidizes the hydrogen selenide into selenium. The thus prepared selenium graphene electrode material pairs with an ether electrolyte system, 1.5M lithium bi-trifluoromethane sulfonimide (LiTFSI)/1,3-dioxolane (DOL)+dimethyl ether (DME) (volume ratio 1:1); the charging specific capacity reaches 640 mAh/g (approaching selenium theoretical specific capacity) in the first cycle. But in the charge-discharge process, polyselenide ions dissolve in the electrolyte, showing significant amounts of the shuttle effect, which causes the subsequent capacity decay. At the same time, the procedures for preparing the graphene oxide raw material that is used in this process are complicated, not suitable for industrial production.

Patent CN104201389B discloses a lithium-selenium battery cathode material, utilizing a nitrogen-containing layered porous carbon composite current-collector which was compounded with selenium. In preparing the nitrogen-containing layered porous carbon composite current collector, nitrogen-containing conductive polymer is first deposited or grown on the surface of a piece of paper, followed by alkali activation and high temperature carbonization, resulting in a nitrogen-containing layered porous carbon composite current collector with carbon fiber as network structure that supports itself; and such nitrogen-containing layered porous carbon composite current collector is then further compounded with selenium. The deposition method for preparing a conductive polymer is complicated and the process for film formation or growth is hard to control. The preparation process is complicated, which associates with undesirably high costs.

Moreover, the demand for a long life, high-energy-density and high-power-density rechargeable battery with the ability of being charged and discharged at a fast rate is ever increasing in electronics, electric/hybrid vehicles, aerospace/drones, submarines, and other industrial, military, and consumer applications. Lithium ion batteries are examples of rechargeable batteries in the above-mentioned applications. However, the need for better performance and cycling capability have not been filled with lithium ion batteries as the technology in lithium ion battery has matured.

Atomic oxygen has an atomic weight16and has a capability for 2 electron transfers. A lithium-oxygen rechargeable battery has been studied for the purpose of making high energy density batteries. When a battery involves an oxygen cathode that pairs with lithium or sodium metal as an anode, it has the greatest stoichiometric energy density. However, a majority of technical problems in the Li//Na-Oxygen battery remains unresolved.

Elemental sulfur is also in the oxygen group and has the second highest energy density (after oxygen) when paired with a lithium or sodium metal anode. A lithium-sulfur or sodium-sulfur battery has been widely studied. However, polysulfide ions (intermediates) that form during the Li—S or Na—S battery discharging process dissolve in the electrolyte and shuttle from cathode to anode. Upon reaching the anode, polysulfide anions react with lithium or sodium metal, resulting in a loss of energy density, which is undesirable for a battery system. In addition, sulfur is an insulator, which requires a high loading level of carbon materials to achieve a minimum level of electrical conductivity. Due to the extremely low electrical conductivity of sulfur, a Li/Na—S rechargeable battery is very difficult to discharge or charge at a fast rate.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

11992809	"This invention relates to a device for separating components of a gas mixture.

It might be desirable to separate components of a gas mixture because one component of the mixture confers undesirable properties on the mixture. It might also be desirable to separate components of a mixture if different components of the mixture are useful for different applications. An example of a device for separating components of a gas mixture is an air separator which is used to separate oxygen and nitrogen, generating oxygen enriched air and nitrogen enriched air.

U.S. Pat. No. 9,340,297 discloses an air separation module which includes a housing and a gas separation membrane within the housing. The gas separation membrane comprises a bundle of hollow fibre membranes, each fibre membrane having a wall of a permeable, porous material. A gas mixture supplied to the disclosed module flows along a central support tube from a feed port at one end of the housing to a header region at the opposite other end. The gas mixture then flows through the fibres of the gas separation membrane from the header region to a retentate port located at the same end of the housing as the feed port. Permeate gases which pass through the walls of the fibres flow out of the module through a permeate port in the wall of the housing towards the opposite end.

GB-A-2533585 discloses fuel tank inserting systems. In such systems, a gas comprising oxygen (typically air taken from an engine bleed and then cooled) is passed through a gas separating material which removes at least some of the oxygen from the gas stream. Modules comprising such gas separating materials are available from Parker Filtration & Separation BV, Etten-Leur, Netherlands under the trade marks SmartFluxx and HiFluxx. The oxygen depleted gas stream is then fed to a fuel tank. Similar gas separation modules are also used to provide gas with increased oxygen content. Such modules can also be used to supply oxygen-enhanced air to patients for example. Gas separation in such modules effectively results in removal of nitrogen from inlet air, thereby providing an outlet gas with an enhanced oxygen content.

The separation efficiency of a gas separation membrane can deteriorate with use. It is common practice to replace a separation module, including the housing and the membrane within it, after a period of use in order to maintain a desired separation efficiency.

The present invention provides a device for separating components of a gas mixture, in which the housing has a body portion and an end cap, and in which an insert comprising a plurality of hollow fibres is fastened to the end cap at least temporarily so that the insert is withdrawn from within the body portion when the end cap is separated from the body portion.

The invention therefore provides a device for separating components of a gas mixture which comprises:a. a hollow housing having a first end wall at a first end, a second end wall at a second end opposite to the first end, and at least one side wall, in which the housing has a body portion which provides the first end, and an end cap which provides the second end and can be separated from the body portion to allow access to the interior of the body portion, and in which the housing has (a) an inlet port for the gas mixture, (b) a permeate outlet port for gas mixture which is enriched with a first component of the mixture, and (c) a retentate outlet port for gas mixture which is enriched with a second component of the mixture, and the inlet port and the retentate outlet port are provided in the body portion of the housing,b. an insert located within the housing, comprising a plurality of hollow fibres made from a material which is more permeable to the first component of the mixture than it is to the second component of the mixture, in which the fibres extend along the insert between its first and second ends,in which the housing defines a space at its first end which communicates with the ends of the fibres at the first end, and the insert defines at least one passageway for gas to flow between the ends of the fibres at the second end and the retentate outlet port for the gas mixture to flow from the space to the retentate outlet port,and in which the insert is fastened to the end cap at least temporarily so that the insert is withdrawn from within the body portion of the housing when the end cap is separated from the body portion.

The device can be serviced efficiently by separating the end cap from the body portion of the housing, so that the insert is withdrawn from the body portion for replacement. A temporary fastening between the end cap and the insert allows the insert to be unfastened from the end cap and replaced, prior to re-assembling the end cap and the body portion to form the housing. The end cap can effectively be used as a tool to facilitate removal or insertion of both of the insert. The end cap might be replaced with the insert when the end cap cannot readily be separated from the insert.

The provision of at least the inlet port and the retentate outlet port, and preferably also the permeate outlet port, in the body portion of the housing has the advantage that an insert can be removed from the housing without any requirement to disturb the connections between the device and the conduits for the untreated gas mixture, the retentate output gas, and optionally also the permeate output gas.

The device can therefore be serviced by replacement of the insert within the housing when the device is in a location in which access is limited. In particular, access to the device might be restricted so that it is only possible to access the end cap portion of the housing to allow the end cap to be detached from the body portion. This can be an advantage when the device is located close to other equipment.

Factors which might affect the arrangement of the inlet port and the retentate outlet port on the body portion of the housing can include the configuration of the insert and the arrangement of connections to conduits for the untreated gas mixture and the retentate output gas. At least one of the inlet port and the retentate outlet port can be provided on the first end wall of the body portion. One of the inlet ports and the retentate outlet port can be provided centrally on the first end wall of the housing. This can be convenient when the passageway defined by the insert extends along a central axis of the housing. A central port on the first end wall of the housing can then be connected to the passageway for flow of fluid through the port and the passageway (although the port with which the passageway communicates might be on a side wall of the housing).

When gas is caused to flow between the said space and the retentate outlet port, the gas may have been enriched with the second component. The gas mixture may pass along the hollow fibres (where it is enriched with the second component) and into the passageway before flowing to the retentate outlet. Thus, gas flowing into the passageway may be considered to have been enriched with the second component.

Optionally, at least one of the retentate outlet port and the inlet port for the gas mixture is in the first end wall of the housing. Optionally, at least one of the retentate outlet port and the inlet port for the gas mixture is in a side wall of the housing. For example, the retentate outlet port can be provided in the first end wall of the housing (especially approximately centrally in the first end wall of the housing) and the inlet port for the gas mixture can be provided in the side wall of the housing (especially adjacent to the first end of the housing).

The direction of flow through the passageway will depend on whether the port with which the passageway communicates is the gas inlet port or the retentate outlet port. When the gas flowing along the passageway is flowing towards the retentate outlet port, the mass flow of the gas will be less compared with the mass flow that would flow along the passageway from the gas inlet port (under similar operating conditions). This is because of the loss from the gas mixture of the permeate gas. A smaller passageway might then be used when requirements placed on it in terms of mass flow of gas are less, allowing more membrane fibres to be incorporated in an insert for a fixed insert size.

When one of the inlet ports and the retentate outlet port is provided centrally on the first end wall of the housing, the other of inlet port and the retentate outlet port can be provided a side wall of the body portion of the housing. The port that is provided in a side wall of the body portion can be at or close to the first end of the housing, for example substantially immediately adjacent to the first end wall of the housing.

The permeate outlet port can be provided on a side wall of the body portion the housing. The location of the permeate port along the length of the housing can be selected to suit the requirements of a particular application. For example, it might be preferred that the permeate outlet port is located at or close to the second end of the housing, or part way along the length of the housing. Frequently, it will be preferred that the permeate outlet port is located at or close to the first end of the housing. This can facilitate the formation of connections to multiple devices in parallel in a manifold arrangement.

Providing one of the inlet port and the retentate outlet port on the first end wall of the housing and the other of the inlet port and the retentate outlet port on a side wall of the housing can facilitate the formation of connections to multiple devices in parallel in a manifold arrangement, especially when that port is provided at or close to the first end of the housing. The formation of connections to multiple devices in parallel in a manifold arrangement can be further facilitated by providing the permeate outlet port on a side wall of the body portion of the housing, especially when that port is also provided at or close to the first end of the housing.

Seals should be provided to minimise (ideally, to prevent) mixing of any or all of the inlet gas mixture, the permeate, and the retentate. A seal can be provided between the passageway in the insert and whichever of the inlet port and the retentate outlet port it is that the passageway communicates with. Each seal might be provided by an O-ring, for example. For example, when the passageway is provided by a tube which is received within a socket provided in the port, the tube can have an O-ring or other seal on its external surface. Alternatively, or in addition, an O-ring or other seal might be provided within the socket. When the passageway provides a socket in which a tube provided by the port is received, an O-ring or other seal can be provided within the socket, or an O-ring or other seal can be provided on the external surface of the tube.

A seal can be provided between the insert and the internal wall of the housing towards the first end of the housing to seal the space at the first end of the housing between the end of the insert and the first end wall. The seal can be provided by an O-ring on the insert which can engage an annular seat on the internal wall of the housing, especially a seat which is on the internal side wall of the housing. This seal can help to minimise (ideally, prevent) mixing of the permeate which has permeated the material of the fibres with whichever of the inlet gas mixture and the retentate is in the space at the first end of the housing.

A seal can be provided between the insert and an internal surface of the body portion of the housing towards the second end of the housing. The seal can be provided by an O-ring on the insert which can engage an annular seat on the internal wall of the housing, especially a seat which is on the internal side wall of the housing. This seal can help to minimise (ideally, prevent) mixing of the permeate which has permeated the material of the fibres with whichever of the inlet gas mixture and the retentate is in the space defined by the end cap at the second end of the housing which communicates with the ends of the fibres at the second end. The seal between the insert and an internal surface of the body portion of the housing can be arranged so that it is made when the insert is positioned in the body portion of the housing.

A seal can be provided between the insert and the end cap. The seal can be provided by an O-ring on the insert which can engage an annular seat on the internal wall of the housing, especially a seat which is on the internal side wall of the end cap. This seal can help to minimise (ideally, prevent) mixing of the permeate which has permeated the material of the fibres with whichever of the inlet gas mixture and the retentate is in the space defined by the end cap at the second end of the housing which communicates with the ends of the fibres at the second end. The seal between the insert and the end cap can be arranged so that it is made when the insert is assembled with the end cap, which will generally be prior to offering the end cap and the insert to the body portion of the housing for assembly of the device.

The device can therefore include an O-ring for forming a seal between the insert and an internal surface of the body portion of the housing at the end of the body portion of the housing immediately adjacent to the end cap, and another O-ring for forming a seal between the insert and the end cap at the end of the end cap immediately adjacent to the body portion of the housing. These seals can be provided on the insert.

An advantage of providing one or more of the seals on the insert is that the seals can then be replaced conveniently when the insert is removed from the housing, especially when the insert is being replaced with a new or otherwise different insert.

The device can have a central axis, with the passageway extending along the central axis of the device. The device can be elongate so that its length measured along its central axis is greater than its transverse dimension (which will be its diameter when the device is circular when viewed in cross-section).

Advantages of the invention arise from the fact that the insert is fastened to the end cap at least temporarily so that the insert is withdrawn from within the body portion of the housing when the end cap is separated from the body portion. The insert and the end cap can have mating formations by which they can be connected to one another, at least temporarily. For example, the insert and the end cap can have mating bayonet formations by which the insert and the end cap can be fastened to one another. The insert and the end cap can have mating threads by which the insert and the end cap can be fastened to one another. The insert and the end cap might be connected to one another in such a way that they cannot readily be separated. For example, the insert and the end cap might be bonded to one another, for example by means of a third material (such as an adhesive) or without use of a third material (such as by means of a weld).

The insert and the body section might include mating formations by which they can be connected to one another when the insert is positioned in the body section. Mating formations on the insert and the body section can make more secure a seal between the insert and the body section. A connection between the insert and the body section can contribute to the security of the connection between the end cap and the body section. A connection between the insert and the body section can enable the insert to reinforce the housing so that it is better able to withstand the internal pressure and other forces (for example due to vibration) that it is exposed to during use. Mating formations on the insert and the body section might be for example threads or bayonet formations.

The relative lengths of the end cap and the body portion of the housing depend on the location along the length of the housing of the interface between the end cap and the body portion. It will often be preferred that the end cap is relatively short, and the body portion is relatively long. This allows the permeate outlet on the body portion to be located towards the second end of the housing if this might be seen as desirable for a particular application. It can also have the advantage that the portion of the housing which is detached with the insert from the remainder of the housing is relatively small and therefore light. Furthermore, locating the interface is close to the second end of the housing can facilitate access to the interface between the end cap and the body portion, for example in order to loosen fasteners which are located at the interface. Accordingly, the ratio of the length of the body portion of the housing to the length of the end cap and body portion of the housing when they are fastened to one another can be at least about 0.7, optionally at least about 0.8, especially at least about 0.9.

The materials used to make the housing are known from existing gas separation devices. They should be sufficiently robust to withstand the conditions to which they will be exposed during installation and use. In particular, the materials should be chosen so that the housing can withstand the pressure differential across its wall, and other forces to which it is exposed during use such as forces arising from vibration. It will often be preferred that the same material is used to form the body portion and the end cap of the housing. The housing might be made from one or more polymeric materials. Polymeric materials might be reinforced by means of filler material, for example in the form of fibres. The housing might be made from one or more metallic materials, such as aluminium and aluminium alloys. Housing parts might be made by techniques such as casting or machining or 3D printing. Manufacture of parts by machining can be preferred for some applications.

The construction of the housing can be such that it is by itself capable of withstanding the pressure differential across its wall. It might be preferable for some applications for components within the housing to reinforce the housing, enhancing its ability to withstand the pressure differential across its wall and other forces. For example, connections between the insert (especially the ends of a tube which provides the passageway in the insert) and the end cap and body portion of the housing can help to reinforce the housing.

The end cap and the body portion should be capable of being fastened to one another in such a way that the connection between them is sealed against flow of fluid into and out of the housing. A suitable arrangement for fastening the end cap and the body portion to one another can be provided by a flange on the end cap and a facing flange on the body portion. Each of the flanges can have a plurality of openings (for example at least four openings) extending through it. The openings in the flanges can be aligned so that a fastener can be inserted into each pair of aligned openings in the flanges on the end cap and the body portion. The openings on the end cap or the openings on the body portion can be threaded so that a threaded fastener can engage the threaded openings to draw the end cap and the body portion together. It can be particularly preferred to use captive screw fasteners which are retained in the openings in the flange of one of the housing parts and engage threads in the openings in the flange of the other housing part. Other fastening arrangements might be used, such as for example one or more flange clamps or other types of couplings.

The materials used to make the insert are known from existing gas separation devices. An example of a material which is known for use in hollow gas-separation fibre membranes is poly(phenylene oxide). The fibre membrane comprises a permeable sponge-like structure with a dense 40 nm cover layer. A bundle of several thousand such hollow fibres is fixed at both ends using a curable polymer (such as an epoxy) within a metal end fitting. An example of such an insert is sold for use in an aerospace application for reducing the oxygen content of air entering a fuel tank. It is sold by Parker Hannifin Manufacturing Netherlands (Filtration and Separation) B V of Etten-Leur, Netherlands. Gas separation devices of this general kind are also known for use in a variety of other applications, including in oil and gas treatment industries, food and beverage packaging and storage, and pneumatic tyre inflation. They are available from Parker Hannifin and from other sources.

The performance of the insert can be optimised by use of fibres whose lengths are closely matched. This can be facilitated by use of fibres which are straight. Variation in the pressure drop along the lengths of the fibres can be minimised if their lengths are closely matched.

The gas separation device of the invention can be used to separate components of a gas mixture where the permeability of the material of the fibres of a first component of the gas mixture is different from that of a second component of the mixture. A device according to the invention might be configured to separate components of ambient air. When ambient air (consisting primarily of nitrogen and oxygen) is passed through such a device, other gases such as water vapour, hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide and other trace gases pass through the wall of the fibres, together with oxygen, so that the retentate is rich in nitrogen and the permeate is rich in oxygen. The retentate can be referred to as nitrogen enriched air (NEA) and the permeate can be referred to as oxygen enriched air (OEA).

As is known, the extent to which the permeate gas components are removed from the retentate can be selected by varying the rate of flow of the gas mixture through the device. A slower flow rate allows greater separation of the components of the gas mixture. For example, the nitrogen content of the permeate in an air separation device might be varied between 95% when operating at 5000 N·m3·h−1and 99.9% when operating at 0.5 N·m3·h−1.

The invention allows an insert within the housing of a gas separation device to be replaced, leaving the housing in place and connections to the device for the gas mixture inlet port and the retentate outlet port intact. It can be preferred for the insert to include a shroud which covers the fibres over at least a portion of the length of the insert. The shroud can help to protect the fibres from damage when the insert is not in the housing. The shroud can be made from materials such as polymers and metals. The physical properties of the material of the shroud should be such that the shroud can protect the fibres. Preferably the wall thickness of the shroud is small so that the shroud is light and that the space taken by the shroud is small. The wall thickness of a suitable shroud might for example be not more than about 0.5 mm, or not more than about 0.2 mm. An example of a suitable material for the shroud is a sheet made from a metal such as aluminium or an aluminium alloy, or from a polymeric material. The shroud can extend over most of the length of the insert to protect the fibres. Openings can be provided in the shroud to allow for escape of the permeate gas for discharge from the device through the permeate outlet port. Openings in the shroud can be particularly appropriate when the shroud extends along the full length of the fibres in the insert. Openings can be provided at the point along the length of the insert so that they are close to, especially adjacent to, the permeate outlet port when the insert is located within the housing. Openings might therefore be provided at or close to one end of the insert when the permeate outlet port is located at or close to an end of the housing. Openings might be provided in an array extending around the insert. Openings might be provided preferentially adjacent to the permeate outlet port relative to the side of the insert opposite to the permeate outlet port, when the insert is located within the housing.

As is known, the size of the device can be selected according to the requirements of a particular application, including gas throughput, gas purity, available space, the ease with which the device can be serviced, and so on. The length of the device can be varied to provide more separation capacity in order to obtain greater gas throughput or greater gas purity or both. For example, the length of the device might be at least about 30 cm. The length of the device might be up to about 2 m or more. The transverse dimension of the device (which will be its diameter when the device is circular when viewed in cross-section) can be also be varied to provide more separation capacity in order to obtain greater gas throughput or greater gas purity or both. Variation in the transverse dimension of the device will frequently involve varying the number of fibres in the insert. The diameter of a device with a circular cross-section might be at least about 10 cm.

The diameter of a device might be up to about 30 cm or more.

The invention also provides an insert for use in a device for separating components of a gas mixture which comprises:a. a first end fitting,b. a second end fitting opposite to the first end fitting,c. a plurality of hollow fibres made from a material which is more permeable to a first component of the mixture than it is to a second component of the mixture, in which the fibres extend along the insert between the first and second end fittings,d. a tube which extends along the insert between the first and second ends, the tube extending beyond the first end fitting to define a spigot portion,e. a first circumferential seal on the outside of the spigot portion of the tube which can form a seal when the spigot portion is received within a socket,f. a second circumferential seal on the outside of the first end fitting,g. third and fourth circumferential seals on the outside of the second end fitting,h. mechanical connection features on the second end fitting.

The device provided by the invention can be useful to prepare nitrogen-enriched air for supply to a fuel tank.

This application is based on and claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0180059 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Dec. 15, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

TECHNICAL FIELD

Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a portable apparatus for measuring a manipulation force of a manipulated part. More particularly, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a portable apparatus for measuring a manipulation force of a manipulated part for measuring a manipulation force of various manipulated parts applied in an interior space of a vehicle.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART

In general, a force (hereinafter, called a manipulation force) required for pushing forward or pulling backward an object may be measured by a push pull gauge. Such a measurement is necessary in the development state of a product, for enabling stable production without an excessive variation in the manipulation force.

For example, the interior space of the vehicle assembled in the factory is provided with manipulated parts operated in various methods according to the manipulation of a user, such as a button-type manipulator, an inner handle of a door, an air vent for adjusting the air blow direction when cooling or heating, a window switch, and a rotation-type dial knob such as an integrated manipulator of a shift-by-wire (SBW) transmission.

These manipulated parts are typically configured to give a feeling of being caught in each manipulation step during the manipulation, to prevent distraction of the user, transfer manipulation feeling, and provide easiness in adjusting control force. At this time, the manipulation force of the manipulated part is tuned such that the user may not feel excessive stiffness, looseness, or the like. That is, the manipulated parts are required to be appropriately tuned during the development stage.

Conventionally, in the development of the vehicle, the manipulation force required for manipulating the manipulated parts are measured by the push pull gauge and turned.

However, a typical conventional push pull gauge is capable of measuring only a single direction of moving forward and backward and may not provide a multi-directional measurement including other directions, for example, a horizontal direction.

In addition, when the push pull gauge may not be positioned in an appropriate direction, for example, due to geometrical interference between surrounding component parts and the manipulated part of the measurement target, the measurement may be difficult, and the measured value may become inaccurate.

In addition, in order to optimize the tuning of the manipulated part, obtaining quantitative data of the change in the manipulation force during a preset operation time is required. However, the conventional push pull gauge may only measure the maximum peak value of the manipulation force thereby not being capable of sufficiently quantifying the manipulation force.

In this case, for tuning the manipulation force, modification of the mold may be repeated according to emotional motivation of the evaluator, which increases development period and cost.

No. 11,009,632 on May 18, 2021, each the disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

1. Field of the Disclosed Embodiments

This disclosure describes delivery systems and methods for binder or matrix suspended particles in a form of multi-layer micron-sized particles that are substantially transparent, yet that exhibit selectable coloration based on physical properties introduced by the manner in which the particles are formed. Layers formed according to the disclosed systems and methods and of the disclosed material compositions selectively scatter specific wavelengths of electromagnetic energy back in an incident direction while allowing remaining wavelengths to pass therethrough. These layers uniquely implement optical light scattering techniques in such energy or light transmissive layers to make those layers appear selectively opaque when observed from a light incident side, while allowing at least 50%, and as much as 80+% of the energy impinging on the light incident side to pass through the layer.

2. Related Art

An ability to provide or promote selective transmission of electromagnetic energy, including light in the visual or near-visual radiofrequency (RF) spectrum, through layers, materials, structures or structural components provides substantial benefit in a number of real-world use cases and applications. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/006,143 (the 143 application), entitled “Systems and Methods for Producing Laminates, Layers and Coatings Including Elements for Scattering and Passing Selective Wavelengths of Electromagnetic Energy”, which was filed in the USPTO on Jan. 26, 2016 and which published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2016/0306078 A1 on Oct. 20, 2016; and Ser. No. 15/006,145 (the 145 application), entitled “Systems and Methods for Producing Objects Incorporating Selective Electromagnetic Energy Scattering Layers, Laminates and Coatings,” which was filed in the USPTO on Jan. 26, 2016, and which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 10,795,062 on Oct. 6, 2020, the disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, describe a basic structure for forming such selectively energy transmissive layers, and certain real world use cases in which those layers may be particularly advantageously employed. The 143 and 145 applications discuss, as background, conventional methods for modifying windows, skylights and the like to limit, filter or otherwise modify an amount of light that is, or constituent wavelengths of the light that are, transmitted into the structure via these windows and/or skylights. The modifications to the formerly transparent structures may limit an ability to see through a particular window or skylight to address privacy, security and/or other related concerns. The 143 and 145 applications discuss conventional techniques that, whether implemented to address simple aesthetics, or for other reasons, modify the light transmissive properties of the windows, skylights and/or constituent panels or panes substantially in both directions equally.

The 143 and 145 applications describe other techniques for modifying some light transmissive properties in certain structural panels including, for example, what are alternatively referred to as one-way or two-way mirrors, and certain high-end vehicle window tinting. Again here it is noted that the light always passes through the mirror or tinted window exactly equally in both directions. Thus, the principle of operation is to keep one side brightly lit rendering that side “difficult” to see through based on the principle that the reflected light masks visual penetration of the mirror from the brightly lit side. The coatings or embedded layers, which are applied to, or included in, the mirror or window panels, ensure that a substantial portion of the incident light is reflected back from the “lighted” side of the mirror or tinted window, adversely affect the light transmissive properties of the ambient light incident to the lighted side of the mirror or tinted window as it passes through the panel.

The 143 and 145 applications note that in recent years, the fields of energy harvesting and ambient energy collection have gained significantly increased interest. The 143 and 145 applications discuss photovoltaic (PV) cell layers and other photocell layers, including thin film PV-type (TFPV) material layers, that are advantageously employed on outer surfaces of particular structures to convert ambient light to electricity. The efficiency of a particular PV layer is affected by its capacity to absorb, and/or to minimize reflectance of, incident light on the surface of the layer. For this reason, photocells and PV light absorbing material layers are generally formed to have dark, normally black or dark grey, exposed light-facing or light-incident (“facial”) surfaces. Maximum conversion efficiencies in operation of the PV layers (upward to 28+%) are achieved when the dark facial surfaces of these PV layers are exposed to unfiltered light in the visible, or near-visible, spectrum. While experimentation has been undertaken with other forms of, for example, thin film PV layers including transparent thin-films, the conversion efficiencies for these non-conventional (or non-black) layers fall to as low as approximately one third the conversion efficiencies of those of the conventional dark facial surfaces generally associated with photovoltaic cell layers. It is for this reason that, in virtually all conventional and most emerging installations, the PV layers are mounted unmodified on external surfaces of structures either (1) fully exposed, or (2) exposed behind clear (or substantially clear) glass, plastic or similar clear (substantially light transparent) protective outer surface layers that transmit the visual, or near-visual light, in an unmodified manner from the light-incident side of such protective layers to the dark facial surfaces of the PV layers. Any such protective outer surface layers may provide some protection against adverse environmental effects and/or damage to facial surfaces of the PV layers, which tend to be comparatively fragile, but they provide generally no manner by which to modify the unfortunate aesthetic drawbacks presented by typical PV cell installations.

The 143 and 145 applications note that significant drawbacks to wider proliferation of photocells used in a number of potentially beneficial operating or employment scenarios are that such “required” installations, in many instances, adversely affect the aesthetics of the structure, object or host substrate surface on which the PV layers are mounted for use. Put another way, it is known that PV layers typically must be visible, in a substantially unimpeded, and/or unfiltered, manner to surrounding ambient light. It is further known that the visual appearance of the PV layers cannot be significantly altered from the comparatively dark greyscale to black presentations provided by the facial surfaces without rendering the photocells significantly less efficient, substantially degrading their operation. Presence of photocells and PV layers in most installations is, therefore, easily visually distinguishable, often in an aesthetically distracting or degrading manner. Based on these drawbacks and/or limitations, inclusion of photocell arrays, and even sophisticated thin film PV layers, is often avoided in many installations, or in association with many structures, objects or products, which may benefit from the electrical energy harvesting capacity provided by these layers. As such, photocell and other PV layer installations often become unacceptable visual detractors or distractors adversely affecting the appearance or ornamental design of the structures, objects or products on which the layers may be otherwise advantageously applied and employed.

SUMMARY

The 143 and 145 applications introduce systems and methods that provide particularly formulated energy or light transmissive overlayers. These overlayers, generally in the form of surface treatments and/or coverings, are formulated to support unique energy transmission and light refraction schemes to effectively “trick” the human eye into seeing a generally opaque presentation of the surface when observed from a light incident side. These overlayers are formulated to support transmission of visual light, or near-visual light, in a manner that allows a substantial percentage of the electromagnetic energy to penetrate the surface treatments and coverings in a comparatively unfiltered manner. Although particularly advantageously employed to support displayed visual optical effects, the principles according to this disclosure may be equally applicable to filtering wavelengths of electromagnetic energy lying outside the visual spectrum. The material compositions disclosed in the 143 and 145 applications, while important, and useful in many operational employment scenarios, are constrained in the manner in which the disclosed layers can be applied. Improvements on the layer compositions disclosed in those applications may provide greater latitude in the manufacturing processes by which objects including the disclosed particularized layers may be formed.

The 143 and 145 applications disclose advanced light scattering layers that are usable as object outer layers, systems for forming those outer layers and layer forming processes that provide particularly-adapted structures and light scattering layers that appear “opaque” from an outer, viewing, observation or energy/light-incident side, but that otherwise provide a comparatively or substantially un-filtered energy/light transmissive property rendering the thus-formed layers, objects and/or object outer layers substantially energy/light transparent, as viewed from an inside of the formed object or from an opposite or non-energy/light-incident side of the formed structural layer or outer layer.

The energy transmissive layers disclosed in the 143 and 145 applications rely on a particular cooperation between refractive indices of the disclosed micron-sized particles or spheres with cooperating refractive indices of the matrix materials in which those micron-sized particles are suspended for deposition on prepared surfaces. This coincident requirement between the refractive indices of the matrix material and the refractive indices of the suspended particles limits deposition of these material suspensions of particles on substrates to techniques in which the deposition of the materials can be carefully controlled.

It would be advantageous to develop techniques by which to provide suspended micron-sized particles in a manner that controls the refractive indices of the developed layers regardless of a delivery method by which the suspensions of micron-sized particles are deposited onto a broad spectrum of substrate surfaces.

Exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this disclosure may improve upon the inventive concepts disclosed in the 143 and 145 applications by controlling the refractive indices of the particles themselves to capture all of the physical parameters leading to independent color selection.

Exemplary embodiments may provide substantially transparent micron-sized particles having a multi-layered structure in which refractive indices of the constituent elements/layers of which the multi-layered particles are controlled to produce repeatable coloration in the substantially transparent micron-sized particles.

Exemplary embodiments may provide a substantially clear outer layer on the multi-layered structure of the substantially transparent micron-sized particles in a manner that assures that particle-to-particle refraction interference is minimized.

Exemplary embodiments may provide matrix agnostic coloration particles allowing for the suspension of such particles in any clear or substantially clear (or transparent) matrix material, which may be then specially formulated to support other physical parameters with respect to the layers formed of the substantially transparent micron-sized particles. Such physical parameters may include, but are not limited to, toughness and durability of the finished layers, adhesion/adherence of the layers to a particular substrate, and/or particular curing techniques (heat curing, photo curing, and other like techniques) of the layers on respective substrates.

Exemplary embodiments may provide particle suspensions that are amenable to being entrained in airstreams for aspirated and/or aerosol delivery of the micron-sized particles in suspension onto various substrate surfaces.

Exemplary embodiments may provide delivery systems and methods for spraying particles suspensions onto various surfaces, and for promoting the formation, development, fixing and/or finishing the electromagnetic energy (or light) transmissive layers on all forms of substrates with wide latitude in the selection of aspirated and/or aerosol delivery devices.

Exemplary embodiments may form individual energy scattering layers out of substantially-transparent micron-sized particles, including nanoparticles, which may be particularly overcoated in substantially energy-neutral layers that control a minimum spacing of the coloration layers of the particles so as to substantially eliminate micro- and/or nano-voids between the particles and yet control spacing of the coloration components of the particles so as to reduce particle-to-particle refractive interference.

In embodiments, refractive indices of the individual particles may be controlled by a layered composition of a structure of the particles that may be tunable according to a controlled forming process in order that the finished layers may provide a selectively-opaque appearance when viewed (or exposed to incident energy) from an energy/light incident side.

In embodiments involving scattering of light in the visual range, a selectively-opaque appearance may be rendered according to an individual user's desires, while the scattering layers are substantially-transparent to other wavelengths of energy/light passing through the finished layers to areas or sensors behind those finished layers according to tuned refraction of the individual particles. Such structures may allow the formed layers to substantially pass at least 50% to in excess of 80% of the incident light through the layers to impinge upon photovoltaic, energy absorbing, light responsive, or light-activated components, energy harvesters, or sensors positioned on a non-light incident side of such layers.

Exemplary embodiments may provide systems, methods, schemes, processes or techniques by which volumes of light scattering particles, suspended in solution or otherwise, may be entrained in an airstream or other gaseous delivery stream for aerosol or aspirated “spray” delivery onto an object or substrate surface.

In embodiments, because the energy/light scattering layers are comprised of substantially-transparent components (particles and fixing matrices), there is virtually no restriction on a particular environment, or to a particular use, in which the layers and/or objects formed of the layers may be operatively deployed for use.

In embodiments, a surface, or surface layer, that appears opaque when viewed from the viewing, observation or light incident side may be made to appear formed of a material of a particular color, or to include a particular pattern, including a multi-color pattern, at the discretion of the user forming the object or object layer.

In embodiments, an appearance of a photocell array, or a thin-film PV layer, may be enhanced by overcoating with a protective layer or film that is particularly arranged to allow an appearance of the photocell array, or thin-film PV layer, to be masked behind the protective layer or film thereby outwardly presenting one or more of a wide range of chosen colors and/or chosen patterns in a manner that does not substantially disrupt or degrade an efficient operation of the photocell array, or thin-film PV layer.

These and other features, and advantages, of the disclosed systems and methods are described in, or apparent from, the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments.

11902517	"TECHNICAL FIELD

This application relates to the field of video coding technologies and, in particular, to a system and method for video coding with adaptive cross-component filter.

BACKGROUND

AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) is an open video coding format designed for video transmissions over the Internet. AV1 was developed as a successor to VP9 by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), a consortium that includes semiconductor firms, video on demand providers, video content producers, software development companies, and web browser vendors. Many of the components of the AV1 project were sourced from previous research efforts by Alliance members. Experimental technology platforms include Daala by Xiph/Mozilla, the experimental VP9 evolution project VP10 by Google, and Thor by Cisco. Building on the codebase of VP9, AV1 incorporates additional techniques, several of which were developed in these experimental formats. Various versions of the AV1 reference codec and bitstream specification were released. The AV1 bitstream specification includes a reference video codec.

ITU-T VCEG (Q6/16) and ISO/IEC MPEG (JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11) published various versions of the H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) standard. These two standard organizations also jointly formed the JVET (Joint Video Exploration Team) to explore the potential of developing the next video coding standard beyond HEVC. In response to a Joint Call for Proposals (CfP) on Video Compression with Capability beyond HEVC issued by these two organizations, more than 40 responses on standard dynamic range (SDR), high dynamic range (HDR), and 360 video categories were submitted. All received CfP responses were evaluated in the 122 MPEG/10th JVET meeting. As a result of this meeting, JVET formally launched the standardization process of next-generation video coding beyond HEVC. The new standard was named Versatile Video Coding (VVC), and JVET was renamed as Joint Video Expert Team. A recent version of VTM (VVC Test Model) is VTM 7.

Cross-component filtering (CCF) is a filtering process that uses sample values of one component to refine another component. An example of CCF is cross-component adaptive loop filter (CC-ALF) proposed in JVET-O0636. Flags are used to signal, e.g., on/off of CCF for blocks in a frame being processed. For example, blocks in a smooth area are signaled to have

CCF turned off. However, as CCF is not performed in a smooth area, signaling of CCF in a smooth area increases the bits overhead and the needed storage space and/or transmission bandwidth, which is especially true for an image frame having large smooth area(s).

The disclosed methods and systems are directed to solve one or more problems set forth above and other problems.

SUMMARY

In accordance with the disclosure, there is provided an image processing method including obtaining statistics information of a block of an image frame, determining whether the statistics information satisfies a condition, and disabling cross-component filtering (CCF) for the block in response to the statistics information satisfying the condition.

Also in accordance with the disclosure, there is provided an electronic device including a processor and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to obtain statistics information of a block of an image frame, determine whether the statistics information satisfies a condition, and disable cross-component filtering (CCF) for the block in response to the statistics information satisfying the condition.

11875206	"BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY

Retail products are commonly marked with UPC-A barcodes, which are black and white indicia that encode standardized product identifiers (Global Trade Identification Numbers, or GTINs). A barcode scanner at a point of sale (POS) terminal can read this identifier from a product, look-up the item name and price in a database, and add the product to a shopper's checkout tally.

Historically, each product has been marked with one barcode. That is changing. Applicant has introduced a different form of barcode (the “Digimarc Barcode” indicia) that avoids drawbacks of conventional barcodes. Instead of being a conspicuous arrangement of black and white lines, or checkerboard arrangement, applicant's indicia encodes data into more globally-dispersed patterns, such as subtle localized changes to luminance or chrominance of a package's artwork, or a sprinkling of small dots across the background of a deli- or bakery-item label. Such dispersed representation of the data makes scanning easier, because the product doesn't have to be manipulated so that a certain small region of the package is in view of the scanner. Some products are now marked with both a conventional barcode, and with a Digimarc Barcode indicia.

FIG.1shows an example—a label that includes both a conventional barcode (a “DataBar” code), and a Digimarc Barcode indicia (the sprinkling of dots in the background).

While advantageous, the introduction of this technology has introduced a new complication: what happens when a product includes both a conventional barcode and a Digimarc Barcode indicia, and they convey different data? The present technology concerns methods and arrangements to address this situation.

This is important because a point of sale scanner should never cause a shopper to be overcharged. If a product conveys both a conventional barcode and a Digimarc barcode, and they convey different data, then a shopper could be charged for two items instead of one.

Prior art POS scanners have employed “double-read” protection systems to avoid double-charging shoppers when a product's barcode is depicted in two close-in-time scanner images.

But this doesn't address the situation in which two different indicia are read, and they convey different data.

(A prior art double-read protection system starts a timer each time a data string is decoded from a barcode. If the exact string is decoded a second time, before the timer has expired, that string is not again reported for inclusion on the shopper's tally, but instead is ignored. Additional details of exemplary double-read protection systems are provided in patent publications U.S. Pat. No. 5,365,048, 20020179715, 20080029604, 20120048933, and 20150090503, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.)

Some packages have previously had multiple barcodes, conveying different data. An example is a box from an online merchant that is shipped by UPS. The merchant and UPS each have their own barcode on the box—each for a different purpose. (The merchant barcode may be a UPC-A barcode that conveys a link to a database record indicating the customer, the order number, and the box contents. The UPS barcode may be a QR code that encodes the airport(s) through which the shipment is to be routed, and the customer's destination address.)

Multiple barcodes with different data is not a problem in such cases because the merchant and UPS employ reader devices that are customized to their respective needs. The barcode reader employed by UPS does not read the barcode employed by the merchant, and vice versa.

In contrast, supermarket scanners can read both conventional barcodes and Digimarc Barcode indicia.

In accordance with one aspect of the present technology, a scanner is equipped to respond to multiple different symbologies printed on a single product. The scanner captures many frames per second, as the product is swiped through a viewing volume. Each frame is decoded, yielding one or more payloads. A reconciliation module compares each newly-decoded payload against a list of payloads previously output by the module, to determine if the current payload is semantically-equivalent to a previously-output payload. If so, the previously-output payload is output again, in lieu of the just-decoded payload. If no equivalent is found, the current payload is output and added to the list for comparison against future payloads.

The foregoing and additional features and arrangements will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying diagrams.

"
12013841	"FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY

Aspects of the disclosure relate to providing apparatus and methods for managing annotation in a quantity of data.

BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

Data science is a rapidly burgeoning field that is essential to the modern economy. Artificial intelligence/machine learning (“AI/ML”) is a closely related field just as essential to modern living. Both data science and AI/ML rely on large quantities of data.

For example, AI/ML requires accurate data for machine training, learning, and testing. Without accurate training data, AI/ML may be limited by the ‘garbage in/garbage out’ philosophy.

One common method of providing accurate training data and data science data is to use annotated documents or other data. In general, a large number of high-quality training documents/data is required to train successful AI/ML algorithms, and accurately labeling/annotating the data is a critical step of data preprocessing in supervised learning, but it is an expensive and time-consuming process. Each mistake or inaccuracy negatively affects a dataset's quality and the overall performance of an AI/ML model. Annotation is typically performed by one or more annotators using a variety of computer tools to associate various labels to various contents of the large quantities of data/documents. Annotation helps to structure data in various ways to be used to train and test various AI/ML models for various applications such as document classification, text extraction, virtual assistants, and other AI/ML uses.

Currently, annotation is performed in person to provide the baseline data for AI/ML models. For example, to train an AI/ML model to extract pertinent information from a series of similar documents (such as, e.g., names and addresses of mortgage holders), a set of training documents is needed. Annotators will label the names and addresses in each training document, and the AI/ML may use the training documents to learn and refine their algorithms.

In addition, to compete and thrive in the global economy, many companies are working with geographically dispersed teams collaborating. Remote and dispersed annotating teams bring diversity, deep local knowledge, and different perspectives to annotation. In many instances, to build a successful AI/ML model, diversity in data is key to avoid biases and develop a fair and inclusive AI/ML model. A team of diverse annotators, based on their location, native language they speak, and other characteristics will help improve quality of annotation.

Training documents may number in the thousands and multiple annotators may be necessary to timely process and annotate the training data. However, current tools and programs used to annotate the data are time-consuming, clunky, inefficient, and not conducive to collaboration between geographically diverse annotators, data scientists, data engineers, computer scientists, and others. Current annotation tools do not allow (one or more of) multi-user collaboration, change tracking, security, document state and status management, in-tool navigation, and original document reference abilities.

Therefore, it would be desirable for apparatus and methods to manage annotation of a large quantity of data, that allow for at least all of the following: multi-user collaboration, change tracking, security, document state and status management, in-tool navigation, and original document reference.

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

It is an object of this disclosure to provide apparatus and methods to manage annotation of a large body of data.

A system for managing concurrent annotation of a body of data is provided. The body of data may include two or more data files. The data files may be text-based or converted to text through any appropriate method. In an embodiment, the data files may be audio, visual, or audiovisual. The system may include one or more remote computers.

Each remote computer may include a communication link that may access a network. The network may be the Internet or an internal network, such as an intranet, without access to the Internet. The remote computer may include non-transitory memory that may store a portion of the body of data, an operating system, and an annotation management engine. The remote computer may have one or more processors coupled to the memory and configured to operate the annotation management engine and the operating system. The processor(s) may also communicate results of the annotation management engine over the network and store, in the memory the portion of the body of data and the annotated data.

The entire body of data may be stored on the remote computer or on a remote server. The server may be centralized or decentralized in various embodiments.

In an embodiment, the annotation management engine is not stored on the remote computer; rather, the engine may be accessed by the remote computer and user through a web browser or similar access program. The engine may be located on a centralized server. In an embodiment, the engine, and data, may be distributed across multiple servers.

The annotation management engine may include a label management module, an annotated data management module, a change management module, a navigation management module, a database management module, and an output management module.

In an embodiment, the label management module may allow a user, such as an annotator or a checker, to apply and remove one or more labels to the body of data to create annotated data. For example, an annotator may label a name as a name, an address as an address, an account number as an account number, a particular item as that item, etc.

In an embodiment, the annotated data management module may capture a start index and an end index of the annotated data, and it may allow a user, such as an annotator, to select a status for the annotated data. For example, an annotator or other user may select a status for a particular data file such as “Active,” “Complete,” “Delete,” and “Needs Further Review.”

In an embodiment, the change management module may capture every action performed on a particular data file. For example, the change management module may track every label added or removed, along with a date-time stamp, and user details. User details may include the identifying information of any user (such as an annotator or checker) who has annotated the file, or even simply viewed the file. In an embodiment, the change management module may generate a csv or spreadsheet report for each data file. The csv/spreadsheet may contain details about multiple data files.

In an embodiment, the navigation management module may allow a user, such as an annotator, checker, or scientist to choose a particular data file of the body of data to be annotated/labeled or viewed. In an embodiment, the navigation management module may automatically skip any data file that has a status of “Active” or “Complete.” Automatically selecting the next document for an annotator to annotate/label may save time and avoid duplication of work, and it frees a user from having to manually track which document or file in the body of data has been annotated or not.

In an embodiment, the database management module may control access to a number of databases, such as a user database, a project database, an annotation database, and a change management database. The user database may include all of the annotators, checkers, data scientists and engineers, and others who have access to a particular body of data. In many situations, access to data may need to be controlled for confidentiality, privacy, or liability purposes.

In an embodiment, the output management module may allow a user to download the annotated data file(s) and some or all of the original data files in the body of data in a number of formats. For example, a typical output format may be JSON (Javascript Object Notation), a spaCy format in the Python programming language, or a csv/spreadsheet format.

In an embodiment, the annotation management engine may allow multiple annotators to annotate/label the same or separate data files of the body of data. For example, the engine may allow multiple annotators located all over the globe to access and annotate the same body of data at the same time. In an embodiment, the engine may also allow multiple data scientists and checkers to use and check the original and annotated data while multiple annotators are simultaneously annotating the body of data.

In an embodiment, the system may include an encryption controller, and the non-transitory memory may include executable instructions and at least one datum configured to authenticate the user. A typical user may need a username and a unique password or PIN to access the engine and body of data. In an embodiment, two-factor authorization may be needed. Other encryption and authentication methods may be used as appropriate.

In an embodiment, the engine and label management module may allow a user to create one or more hotkeys corresponding to one or more labels and then allow the user to apply the corresponding label when the user selects the appropriate hotkey. In an embodiment, the hotkey(s) may be shared over the network so other users may use the same hotkeys.

A method for managing simultaneous annotation of a body of data consisting of two or more data files is provided. The method may include storing, at a centralized server, the body of data. The method may include receiving, at an annotation management engine, user logins from two or more annotators. The annotation management engine may be at the centralized server (and may be accessed through a web browser or similar access program) or at one or more remote computers. Each user login may enable each annotator to select an available data file from the data files. The method may include authenticating each annotator. The method may include displaying, on a monitor near each annotator, the selected data file and a graphical user interface. The graphical user interface may allow each annotator to view the data file and annotate the data file.

The method may include receiving, at the annotation management engine, one or more annotations/labels applied by the first annotator to the data file. Annotations/labels may include, for example, a name as a name, an address as an address, an account number as an account number, a particular item as that item, etc. The annotator may save the labels/annotations.

The method may include locking, at the annotation management engine, the data file. Locking the data file may transform the data file to an annotated data file and prevent the second (or any other) annotator from applying any annotations/labels to the data file. The method may include updating the body of data with the annotated data file and generating, at the annotation management engine, a history of the annotated data file. The history may include the available data file, the annotated data file, the one or more saved labels, an identity of the one or more annotators, and any changes made by the one or more annotators to the available data file. The changes may be time and date-stamped. The history may be stored in a csv format or any other appropriate format.

The method may include unlocking, at the annotation management engine, the data file, allowing the second (or any other) annotator to apply one or more annotations/labels to the data file. For example, two or more annotators may begin working on a single data file, when one saves her annotations, the file may be temporarily locked to prevent the second annotator from applying labels until the first annotator's labels are saved and recorded, at which time the file may be unlocked, allowing the second annotator to apply and save her annotations/labels. After the first annotator's labels/annotations are saved, the second annotator may replace the first annotator in this method and the method may repeat with other data files and the same or other annotators.

In an embodiment, the method may include receiving, at the annotation management engine, a user login from a checker, authenticating the checker, and allowing the checker to view the annotated data file and the history to check the accuracy of the annotations/labels. A checker may be a supervisor or other annotator who checks the annotations/labels for accuracy as accurate annotations may be essential for robust AI/ML models. The method may include receiving a confirmation from the checker that the labels are accurate. Alternatively, the checker may correct the labels/annotations, or assign an annotator to correct the labels/annotations. The method may also include storing the confirmation and the annotated data file as a checked data file and updating the body of data with the checked data file. In an embodiment, the history of the file may also be updated with the actions of the checker.

In an embodiment, the checker may be able to view the annotated data file in real-time while an annotator, including the first or second annotators, applies one or more annotations/labels to the available data file. Viewing the application of annotations in real-time may save time checking the annotations afterwards. In addition, this may be used as a training tool to train annotators. In an embodiment, annotators and other users may be able to view the actions of a checker in real-time.

In an embodiment, the second (or any other) annotator may be able to view the action(s) (e.g., applying labels/annotations) of the first annotator on a data file in real-time. In an embodiment, the first annotator may be able to view the actions of the second (or any other) annotator in real-time.

In an embodiment, the method may include utilizing the checked data file to train an AI/ML algorithm.

In an embodiment, the method may include repeating the previously described steps until the body of data includes a checked data file for each of the data files in the entire body of data.

In an embodiment, the method may include receiving one or more instructions from the first (or any other) annotator to create a hotkey corresponding with a label/annotation. The method may include receiving instructions to apply the label when the hotkey is selected. The method may include sharing the hotkey with the second (or any other) annotator or other user. Sharing hotkeys may increase efficiency of the team.

A method for managing concurrent annotation of a body of data consisting of two or more data files is provided. The method may include storing, at a centralized server, the body of data, receiving, at an annotation management engine, a user login from an annotator enabling the annotator to select an available data file from the data files and authenticating the annotator. The method may include displaying, on a monitor near the annotator, the selected data file along with or as part of a graphical user interface. The graphical user interface may include a navigation and function taskbar, available labels (including color-coded labels), a historical data section, and the available data file. The annotator may be able to apply one or more of the available labels to the available data file.

The method may include receiving, at the annotation management engine, one or more saved labels/annotations applied by the annotator to the data file and locking, at the annotation management engine, the data file. The locking of the data file may transform the data file to an annotated data file and prevent any other annotator or user from applying any label s/annotations.

The method may include updating the body of data with the annotated data file and generating, at the annotation management engine, a history of the annotated data file. The history may include the available data file, the annotated data file, the one or more saved labels, an identity of the one or more annotators, time and date-stamps, and any changes made by the one or more annotators to the available data file. The login and authentication steps above may be repeated by a second annotator. The method may include unlocking, at the annotation management engine, the data file, allowing the second annotator to apply one or more labels/annotations to the data file and then repeating the steps of receiving, storing, locking, and updating the history with any changes made by the second annotator.

In an embodiment, the method may include receiving, at the annotation management engine, a user login from a checker, authenticating the checker, and allowing the checker to view the annotated data file and the history to check the accuracy of the labels/annotations. The method may include receiving a confirmation from the checker that the labels/annotations are accurate, storing the confirmation and the annotated data file as a checked data file, and updating the body of data with the checked data file.

11920103	"BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a method for producing a lubricant in which at first an overbased calcium sulfonate is produced or provided, this is then converted from the vaterite form into the calcite form and, finally, a calcium sulfonate grease is produced by heating the mixture. The invention further relates to a lubricant produced according to this method and to a lubricant comprising at least one ester composition, calcium carbonate and at least one overbased alkylbenzene sulfonate.

PRIOR ART

Lubricating agents or lubricants are used for the reduction of friction and wear, for dampening vibrations, for sealing and as anti-corrosion protection for tools, machines, engines and motor vehicles, aircraft, ships and parts thereof. A distinction is made in this case between liquid (lubricant oils), paste-like (lubricant greases) and solid (solid lubricants such as graphite, for example) lubricants. Lubricating greases are usually composed of a lubricating oil, a thickener and auxiliary and additional substances (additives). Lubricating greases usually contain approx. 80% lubricating oil, 5-10% thickener and 10-15% additives. Mineral oils, natural or synthetic ester oils, polyalphaolefins or silicon oils, for example, can be used as lubricating oils in this case. Synthetic ester oils include monocarboxylic acid esters, dicarboxylic acid esters, polyol esters and complex esters, for example. Apart from different soaps or inorganic substances (e.g. bentonite), calcium sulfonates are frequently used as thickeners and these also have a corrosion-inhibiting effect, in addition to their thickening action in the grease on account of their alkaline properties.

Calcium sulfonate greases which are currently available on the market are based exclusively on mineral oils or synthetic base oils such as polyalphaolefins (PAO). In this case, mineral oils and PAO account for up to 80% of the grease. The core components for producing a calcium sulfonate grease are the so-called overbased calcium sulfonates which are represented by the reaction of alkylbenzene sulfonic acids with calcium hydroxide and calcium oxide through the introduction of carbon dioxide in a mineral carrier oil. The overbased calcium sulfonates which are commercially available usually contain more than 50% mineral oil. It is not possible for quickly biodegradable calcium sulfonate greases to be produced using these constituents. Since a complete dispersal of calcium sulfonates is not usually completely achieved in mineral oils or PAO, solubilizers such as water, organic solvents and acids are added which then have to be removed again following production. Filtration is also often necessary to remove non-dispersed solid particles.

“Biodegradability” is understood to mean the decomposition of a lubricant into inorganic substances such as water, salts, carbon dioxide and biomass with the help of microorganisms. According to the current state of the art, the complete biodegradability of lubricants is determined exclusively by the OECD-301-test methods which are based on CO2production. The biodegradability is determined at the end of a “10-day test window” and after a 28-day test duration. If the lubricant has achieved the required degree of degradation of at least 60% at the end of the 10-day window and also after 28 days' incubation, it is classified as “readily biodegradable” and can be awarded the EU Ecolabel (EEL), for example.

WO 2004/106474 A1 describes lubricants with improved biodegradability which are based on a biodegradable oil such as, for example, a polyol ester (C5-C8) or a polyalkylene glycol, a calcium sulfonate-based thickener and a naturally occurring phospholipid. In this case, however, a mixture of mineral oil-based overbased magnesium and calcium sulfonates is used as the thickener. Due to the not insubstantial mineral oil content, complete biodegradability in accordance with OECD-301 cannot therefore be achieved for the lubricant described in WO 2004/106474 A1.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

It is an object of the invention to provide a method for producing a lubricant which does not require the use or addition of mineral oil and to create a lubricant that is completely biodegradable.

The problem is solved according to the invention by a method for producing a solvent which comprises the following steps:a) preparation of an overbased calcium sulfonate which comprises the following steps:dissolving at least one mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonic acid, wherein at least one alkyl group is a (C3-C30)-alkyl group, in at least one ester composition, wherein the ester composition comprises at least one ester;admixing calcium hydroxide and calcium oxide;heating the mixture to a temperature in the range from 30° C. to 90° C. and introducing carbon dioxide into the mixture, wherein the mixture is adjusted to a base number (TBN) of at most 550 mg KOH/g;b) conversion of the overbased calcium sulfonate from the vaterite form into the calcite form which comprises the following steps:adjusting the mixture to a water content in the range of 2% by wt. to 20% by wt.;heating the mixture to a temperature in the range of 80° C. to 105° C., wherein the mixture is adjusted to a base number of no more than 450 mg KOH/g; andc) production of a calcium sulfonate grease by heating the mixture to a temperature in the range of 90° C. to 200° C.

The method according to the invention is particularly characterized in that both the calcium sulfonate and grease containing said calcium sulfonate are produced exclusively on an ester basis, so that the end product contains no mineral oil and is therefore easily and completely biodegradable. The lubricant according to the invention achieves the required 60% degree of degradation at the end of the so-called 10-day window and also after 28 days and thereby satisfies the requirements of the OECD-301 test method. In addition, the replacement of mineral oil with organic or synthetic esters means that the addition of solubilizers can be dispensed with, so that these no longer have to be removed in a costly manner at the end of the production process. The method according to the invention further ensures that the overbased calcium sulfonates in the reaction mixture are completely dispersed, so that filtration can also be dispensed with at the end of the process.

According to the invention, the conditions for producing the lubricant are selected in such a manner that the ester composition is not decomposed under these conditions. To this end, the base number (TBN=Total Base Number), which is a measure of the basicity of the reaction mixture, i.e. the ability of the substances contained in the mixture to neutralize acid, is determined during the process. The unit [mg KOH/g] in this case relates to the basicity of potassium hydroxide (KOH). According to the invention, the basicity of the mixture in step a) is limited to a TBN of no more than 550 mg KOH/g and in step b) to a TBN of no more than 450 mg KOH/g. Monitoring and adjusting or limiting the basicity of the mixture advantageously results in the esters not being saponified in the mixture, in particular not even under the influence of the high temperatures in steps b) and c). The moderate addition of water also contributes to this. Adjusting the mixture to a water content in the range of 2% by wt. to 20% by wt. in step b) significantly reduces the possibility of hydrolysis of the esters. Selecting the lowest possible temperatures, particularly in steps a) and b), also advantageously leads to the esters remaining stable in the mixture. In this way, a mineral oil-free, biodegradable calcium sulfonate grease can be produced in a particularly advantageous manner.

The at least one alkyl group of the mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonic acid may be linear, branched and/or cyclic alkyl groups. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is provided in this case that at least one alkyl group of the mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonic acid is a (C10-C18)-alkyl group.

The ester composition may comprise a synthetic ester and/or a native (organic) ester, for example. Suitable esters are, for example, mono- and dicarboxylic acid esters, polyol esters and complex esters, but also native ester oils such as rapeseed oil, for example. The ester composition in this case may be composed of an ester or a mixture of two or more different esters. The ester composition should preferably have a viscosity in the range of 2 mm2/s to 1,200 mm2/s, preferably 10 mm2/s to 500 mm2/s.

An advantageous embodiment of the invention further provides that the mixture in step a) is adjusted to a base number (TBN) in the range of 150 to 550 mg KOH/g, preferably 210 to 450 mg KOH/g or 320 to 420 mg KOH/g, in particular 211 to 399 mg KOH/g. Alternatively, the base number of the mixture in step a) can also be adjusted to a TBN in the range of 200 to 500 mg KOH/g or 300 to 500 mg KOH/g or 400 to 500 mg KOH/g or 150 to 450 mg KOH/g or 250 to 450 mg KOH/g or 350 to 450 mg KOH/g or 200 to 400 mg KOH/g or 300 to 400 mg KOH/g.

A further advantageous embodiment of the invention provides that the mixture in step b) is adjusted to a base number (TBN) in the range of 50 to 450 mg KOH/g, preferably 70 to 350 mg KOH/g or 100 to 250 mg KOH/g, in particular 80 to 220 mg KOH/g. Alternatively, the base number of the mixture in step b) can also be adjusted to a TBN in the range of 100 to 450 mg KOH/g or 200 to 450 mg KOH/g or 300 to 450 mg KOH/g or 350 to 450 mg KOH/g or 50 to 300 mg KOH/g or 100 to 300 mg KOH/g or 200 to 300 mg KOH/g or 150 to 250 mg KOH/g.

A further advantageous embodiment of the invention provides that the mixture in step a) is heated to a temperature in the range of 35° C. to 85° C. or 45° C. to 60° C., in particular 40° C. to 82° C. Alternatively, the mixture in step a) can also be heated to a temperature in the range of 45° C. to 85° C. or 55° C. to 85° C. or 65° C. to 85° C. or 75° C. to 85° C. or 40° C. to 70° C. or 50° C. to 70° C. or 60° C. to 70° C. or 50° C. to 80° C. or 55° C. to 75° C. In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the mixture in step b) is heated to a temperature in the range of 87° C. to 102° C. or 85° C. to 100° C., in particular 88° C. to 99° C. Alternatively, the mixture in step b) can also be heated to a temperature in the range of 90° C. to 102° C. or 95° C. to 102° C. or 87° C. to 100° C. or 90° C. to 100° C.

A further advantageous embodiment of the invention provides that the mixture in step c) is heated to a temperature in the range of 100° C. to 180° C. or 110° C. to 170° C., in particular 125° C. to 160° C. Alternatively, the mixture in step c) can also be heated to a temperature in the range of 120° C. to 180° C. or 130° C. to 180° C. or 140° C. to 180° C. or 150° C. to 180° C. or 160° C. to 180° C. or 150° C. to 170° C. or 100° C. to 160° C. or 110° C. to 160° C. or 120° C. to 160° C. or 130° C. to 160° C. or 140° C. to 160° C. or 170° C. to 180° C.

An advantageous embodiment of the invention further provides that the water content of the mixture in step b) is adjusted to a content in the range of 5% by wt. to 18% by wt., in particular 7% by wt. to 15% by wt. Alternatively, the water content of the mixture in step b) can also be adjusted to a content in the range of 5 to 15% by wt. or 10 to 15% by wt. or 7 to 18% by wt. or 10 to 18% by wt. or 9 to 13% by wt.

In order to adjust the basicity of the reaction mixture in step b) to a desired TBN, calcium hydroxide and/or at least one mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonic acid, wherein at least one alkyl group is a (C3-C30) alkyl group, and/or at least one ester composition, wherein the ester composition comprises at least one ester, can be admixed to the mixture. In addition, by adding one or more of the aforementioned substances, the conversion from the vaterite form to the calcite form can be positively influenced in relation to the completeness of the conversion.

In order to further improve the properties of the lubricant according to the invention, additional auxiliary materials and/or additives can be admixed to the reaction mixture. For example, acetic acid can added, preferably in step b), in order to adjust the desired basicity, where appropriate, and achieve an increase in the dropping point due to the resulting calcium acetate. Furthermore, preferably following the conversion into the calcite form, 12-hydroxystearic acid can be admixed, in order to optimize the lubricant in terms of its hydrophobic properties, i.e. its ability to resist water. So that the anti-corrosion protection of the lubricant can be further improved, phenolic antioxidants (e.g. Irganox® L 107, BASF), aminic antioxidants (e.g. Irganox® L 57, BASF) and/or dimercaptothiadiazole derivatives (ADDITIN® RC 8213 (Lanxess)) can be added. All customary additives which improve the consistency and properties of the lubricant according to the invention can be added in principle.

The invention further relates to a lubricant which has been produced by means of the method according to the invention described above. The lubricant according to the invention does not contain any mineral oil and is therefore readily biodegradable according to the requirements of the OECD-301 test method. In addition, unlike mineral oil-containing lubricating greases, it is still flowable, even at very low temperatures (−10° C. to −20° C.), and furthermore has a higher pressure-absorption capacity.

The problem is furthermore solved by a mineral oil-free lubricant which comprises at least one ester composition comprising at least one ester, calcium carbonate and at least one overbased mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonate, wherein at least one alkyl group of the mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonate is a (C3-C30) alkyl group. The lubricant according to the invention is mineral oil-free and contains exclusively esters as the oil component, so that it is readily biodegradable in accordance with the requirements of the OECD-301 test method. Since only esters are contained as the oil constituent rather than mineral oil, the lubricant according to the invention is still flowable, even at very low temperatures, (−10° C. to −20° C.) and also has a very high pressure-absorption capacity.

The at least one alkyl group of the mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonate may be linear, branched and/or cyclic alkyl groups. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is provided in this case that at least one alkyl group of the mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonate is a (C10-C18) alkyl group.

The ester composition may comprise a synthetic ester and/or a native (organic) ester, for example. Examples of suitable esters are mono- and dicarboxylic acid esters, polyol esters and complex esters, but also native ester oils such as rapeseed oil, for example. The ester composition in this case may be composed of an ester or a mixture of two or more different esters. The ester composition should preferably have a viscosity in the range of 2 mm2/s to 1200 mm2/s, preferably 10 mm2/s to 500 mm2/s.

It is provided in an advantageous embodiment of the invention that the mineral oil-free lubricant comprises 30% by wt. to 80% by wt. of the ester composition, 5% by wt. to 20% by wt. calcium carbonate and 5% by wt. to 25% by wt. of the overbased mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonate.

A particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention provides that the mineral oil-free lubricant comprises 50% by wt. to 65% by wt. of the ester composition, 10% by wt. to 15% by wt. calcium carbonate and 12% by wt. to 20% by wt. of overbased mono-, di- or tri-alkylbenzene sulfonate.

The lubricant according to the invention may, in addition, comprise an additive. Examples of additives which may be contained are phenolic antioxidants (e.g. Irganox® L 107, BASF), aminic antioxidants (e.g. Irganox® L 57, BASF) and/or dimercaptothiadiazole derivatives (ADDITIN® RC 8213 (Lanxess)).

The invention relates to equipment for testing biological specimen, and relates particularly to testing equipment with a magnifying function or an analyte quantification function.

BACKGROUND

Currently, testing of liquid contents, are typically consigned to professional testing authorities for performing testing using expensive microscope equipment with high magnification ratios. Since an individual does not have microscope equipment, the testing activity cannot be performed by the individual.

However, in some testing categories nowadays testing is required to be performed on a regular basis; therefore, the need for frequent testing poses an excessive burden in terms of time and expense. For example, the category of long term testing includes semen testing for patients with infertility issues. The semen testing is mainly directed to performing observations on the number of sperms, their motility and morphology.

The semen testing method involves resting semen of a male subject at a room temperature for a period of time, taking a drop of the sample, instilling the sample to a slide, and observing the sample under a microscope. The observations not only include performing high magnification observation of individual sperm to identify the external appearance of individual sperm, but also include performing observations of overall sperms in a large quantity, their motility, morphology and the quantity per unit area. However, an individual cannot perform the semen testing by himself because the industry has not yet developed a technology that allows an individual to perform testing through a simple aiding device.

Field

The present disclosure is generally directed to cellular communication network systems, and more specifically, to the application of machine learning models in such systems.

Related Art

Cellular communication systems, such as beyond 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems (i.e., 5G and beyond) are being rapidly deployed for many industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to their ubiquitous connectivity and ability to host scalable applications at the edge of the telco networks. These applications will be served by machine learning (ML) models. Due to the time varying nature of the wireless cellular network in such systems, the received data fidelities that are input to these models can vary in an unpredictable way.

SUMMARY

In related art implementations, ML models are developed without active consideration of the phenomenon in the received data fidelities. At most, such related art implementations consider cases when data fidelities are different, but try to train a single model that is robust over all fidelities. The model performance can be improved by training different ML models for different groups of data fidelities and then selecting service platform resources (such as compute and storage resources of the virtual machine (VM)/container) to execute these models based on data fidelities and also on application Quality of Service (QoS). The example implementations described herein are focused on such aspects.

Example implementations address the received data fidelities in cellular communication systems through the use of functions that obtain the signal level and interference information in the application layer. Such example implementations can be utilized in cellular communication systems such as beyond 4G LTE systems through using the functions defined into such systems.

In example implementations for the training and operating of ML models, there are runtime environments (e.g., VM/containers), to each of which cellular enabled applications are assigned. Each of the applications can involve several ML model options, each of which are associated with appropriate data fidelity levels (e.g., a first model A is good for a first data set B having good quality, and a second model A′ is good for a second data set B′ with low quality). In example implementations, the compute/storage resource allocation for each runtime environment that is implementing a application based on the QoS level assigned to the application and fidelity associated to the ML model which is included in the application, and to train each of the ML models (A and A′) separately using the allocated resource to each application/model.

In example implementations for the operation of the ML models and the c applications, one of the ML models is selected for each of the applications based on the current data fidelity, allocating the resource for execution of the application with the selected ML model, based on application QoS (considering all applications that have to be operated simultaneously) and data fidelity, and executing the application accordingly using the allocated resources.

The present application is a National Phase of international Application Number PCT/JP2020/048093, filed Dec. 23, 2020, and claims priority to Japanese Patent Application Number 2020-034898, filed Mar. 2, 2020.

TECHNICAL FIELD

This disclosure relates to a two-stroke internal combustion engine and an engine working machine using the two-stroke internal combustion engine as a power source.

BACKGROUND ART

A two-stroke internal combustion engine is often used as a power source in portable working machines such as brush cutters, chain saws, and power blowers. In the two-stroke internal combustion engine, air and a fuel are mixed in a carburetor to generate an air-fuel mixture, and the air-fuel mixture is sucked into a crank chamber. The two-stroke internal combustion engine includes a scavenging passage that allows communication between the crank chamber and a combustion chamber. When a piston is actuated in a cylinder, the air-fuel mixture having been pre-compressed in the crank chamber is introduced into the combustion chamber through the scavenging passage, and scavenging is performed with the air-fuel mixture.

The two-stroke internal combustion engine has a well-known problem of “air-fuel mixture (fresh gas) blow-by”. Specifically, the air-fuel mixture for scavenging introduced into the combustion chamber is directly discharged from an exhaust port of the cylinder. The air-fuel mixture blow-by leads to a waste of fuel, and may cause air pollution.

Further, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-209939, there is given, as an example of a configuration for preventing the air-fuel mixture blow-by, a configuration including a partition wall that divides an intake passage of the carburetor into an air-fuel mixture passage and an air passage. However, such a configuration has problems such as complication of a structure due to the presence of the partition wall, an increase in cost, and intrusion of the air-fuel mixture into the air passage through a gap despite the presence of the partition wall. Further, there is also a configuration including the air-fuel mixture passage and the air passage that are independent of and separate from each other. In this case, such a configuration has problems such as complication of a structure, an increase in cost, and the need for two throttle valves.

Further, as in other engines, it is desired that an air-fuel mixture that is most suitable for an operating state of the engine be supplied to the combustion chamber in the two-stroke internal combustion engine.

Solution to Problem

This disclosure has been made in view of the circumstances described above, and has an object to provide a two-stroke internal combustion engine that prevents air-fuel mixture blow-by at a time of scavenging and allows an air-fuel mixture suitable for an operating state of the engine to be supplied to a combustion chamber.

This disclosure has another object to provide an engine working machine including the two-stroke internal combustion engine as a power source.

In order to solve the problems described above, according to this disclosure, there is provided a two-stroke internal combustion engine, including: a cylinder, which defines a combustion chamber, and has an exhaust port; an ignition device configured to ignite an air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber; a piston configured to reciprocate inside the cylinder through combustion and expansion that occur in the combustion chamber; a crank chamber communicating with an interior of the cylinder; a crankshaft, which is disposed in the crank chamber, and is operationally coupled to the piston; a fuel injection valve configured to supply a fuel to the crank chamber; an intake passage configured to allow only air to be sucked thereinto under a negative pressure generated when the piston is actuated; and a scavenging passage that allows communication between the crank chamber and the combustion chamber, wherein the intake passage branches into a first intake passage and a second intake passage, wherein the first intake passage communicates with the crank chamber, and the second intake passage communicates with the scavenging passage, and wherein the fuel injection valve is configured to inject the fuel toward at least one of the first intake passage or the crank chamber, and air stagnant in the scavenging passage at end of air suction serves as leading air to contribute to scavenging.

According to this disclosure, the fuel is supplied to the crank chamber by the fuel injection valve. Further, a part of air passing through the intake passage is introduced into the crank chamber through the first intake passage, and another part of air is introduced into the crank chamber through the second intake passage and the scavenging passage. At the end of air suction, the air stagnates in the scavenging passage. The air that has been introduced into the crank chamber is mixed with the fuel to generate an air-fuel mixture. The air-fuel mixture in the crank chamber is introduced into the combustion chamber through the scavenging passage by actuating the piston. The air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber is compressed by the piston, and is ignited by the ignition device to cause combustion and expansion. Discharge and scavenging are achieved while the piston is being pushed back by the combustion and expansion. Specifically, when an exhaust port is opened, a combustion gas is discharged therefrom. Subsequently, the air stagnant in the scavenging passage is pressure-fed into the combustion chamber, and serves as the leading air to contribute to the scavenging. Through the scavenging, the combustion gas is discharged from the exhaust port.

As described above, according to this disclosure, the fuel is supplied to the crank chamber by the fuel injection valve. Thus, fuel supply timing can easily be controlled, thereby enabling supply of the air-fuel mixture suitable for an operating state of the engine. Further, a part of air is introduced into the crank chamber through the second intake passage and the scavenging passage. Thus, at the end of air suction, air stagnates in the scavenging passage. The air serves as the leading air to contribute to the scavenging. Thus, air-fuel mixture blow-by, which may occur at a time of scavenging, is prevented. As a result, an exhaust gas is improved in components thereof. Further, only air is sucked into the intake passage. Thus, unlike an intake passage of a related-art carburetor, a partition wall for partitioning the intake passage into an air-fuel mixture passage and an air passage or a plurality of throttle valves are not required. Thus, the intake passage has a simple structure. The suction of only air into the intake passage not only enables easy control of intake air but also contributes to improvement of reliability of the air control.

As one embodiment, the fuel injection valve may be configured to inject the fuel in a direction that avoids the scavenging passage. In this manner, the fuel is less liable to be mixed the stagnant air in the scavenging passage.

As one embodiment, the fuel injection valve may include a high-pressure fuel injection valve configured to receive a fuel pressure from at least one of an electrically-driven fuel pump or a pump configured to operate through rotation of the crankshaft. This fuel injection valve enables the fuel injection to an aimed position.

As one embodiment, the fuel injection valve may be configured to inject the fuel at high pressure toward an area required to be cooled in the cylinder or the crank chamber. This configuration allows the area required to be cooled to be effectively cooled with the fuel injected from the fuel injection valve at high pressure.

As one embodiment, the fuel injection valve may include a high-pressure fuel injection valve capable of injecting the fuel when the crank chamber has a maximum internal pressure while the piston is being actuated. The use of this fuel injection valve enables optimization of timing of fuel injection into the crank chamber, thus components of the exhaust gas is improved thereof, such as suppressing the mixing gasoline with the leading air.

As one embodiment, an engine working machine includes the two-stroke internal combustion engine as a power source. This engine working machine has the following advantages. A working machine, in particular, a handheld or backpack type portable working machine is desired to be reduced in size and weight in terms of workability and handleability. With a related-art configuration in which a carburetor has a partition wall or an air-fuel mixture passage and an air passage are independent of and separate from each other, however, reduction in size and weight of the working machine is limited. Meanwhile, since the engine working machine according to one embodiment includes the two-stroke internal combustion engine having a simple structure as a power source, it can contribute to reduction in size and weight of the working machine.

As one embodiment, the fuel injection valve may be installed on a side where a fuel tank is arranged with respect to a plane containing an axis of the cylinder and an axis of the crankshaft. This configuration allows the fuel tank and the fuel injection valve to be positioned closer to each other. Thus, a pipe provided between the fuel tank and the fuel injection valve requires only a short length, which further contributes to reduction in size and weight of the working machine. Further, in this case, the fuel can be quickly fed to the fuel injection valve because of a short distance between the fuel tank and the fuel injection valve. Thus, an engine can be started in a desirable manner. In particular, in a case of a high-pressure fuel injection valve that is used together with an electrically-driven fuel pump provided to a fuel tank, a distance between the electrically-driven fuel pump and the injection valve is short. Thus, the fuel can be relatively easily supplied to the fuel injection valve at a time of engine start, thereby achieving improved startability.

As one embodiment, the fuel injection valve may have a fuel inlet at a rear end and be configured to inject the fuel upward, and a fuel tank may be arranged below the crank chamber. Also in this case, the same action effects as those described above are obtained.

A respective audio signal may be provided from any audio signal source, such as a data carrier device, such as USB-stick, a radio device, such as a FM radio, a network device, such as a network application, a mobile device, such as a smartphone, smartwatch, tablet, notebook, etc. The apparatus may thus, be connectable or connected with a respective audio signal source.

The apparatus comprises at least one audio outputting device configured to output and/or reproduce at least one audio signal, particularly an audio signal comprising at least one audio signal component containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice, in a vehicle cabin. The at least one audio outputting device typically, comprises one or more audio outputting elements, such as loudspeakers. Each audio outputting element may be assigned to a specific location or space, i.e. particularly to a specific seat, in the or a vehicle cabin of a vehicle being equipped with the apparatus. The one or more audio outputting elements are typically, arrangeable or arranged so as to output a respective audio signal in the or a vehicle cabin. The one or more audio outputting elements may be arrangeable or arranged at and/or in structural elements, e.g. instrument panels, pillars, doors, ceiling, etc., of a vehicle being equipped with the apparatus. Notably, the one or more audio outputting elements and the at least one audio outputting device, respectively can be standard components of a vehicle audio system implemented by the apparatus. Hence, at least from a structural point of view, the at least one audio outputting device of the apparatus can be a standard audio outputting device of a vehicle audio system.

The apparatus further comprises at least one audio receiving device configured to receive a human voice signal, e.g. the voice of at least one person singing along an audio signal, particularly a musical piece, of at least one person located in the or a vehicle cabin of the or a vehicle equipped with the apparatus whilst the at least one audio outputting device outputs the or an audio signal in the or a vehicle cabin. The term “person” generally refers to any person in the or a vehicle cabin, such as a driver or co-driver, for instance.

The at least one audio receiving device typically, comprises one or more audio receiving elements, such as microphones. Each audio receiving element may be assigned to a specific location or space, i.e. particularly to at least one specific seat, in the or a vehicle cabin of a vehicle being equipped with the apparatus. The one or more audio receiving elements may be arrangeable or arranged at and/or in structural elements, e.g. instrument panels, pillars, doors, ceiling, etc., of a vehicle being equipped with the apparatus so as to receive a human voice signal of at least one person located in the or a vehicle cabin of the or a vehicle equipped with the apparatus whilst the at least one audio outputting device outputs the audio signal in the or a vehicle cabin of the or a vehicle. Notably, the one or more audio receiving elements and the at least one audio receiving device, respectively can be standard components of a vehicle audio system implemented by the apparatus. Hence, at least from a structural point of view, the at least one audio receiving device of the apparatus can be a standard audio receiving device of a vehicle audio system.

The at least one audio receiving device, thus allows for live receiving a human voice, i.e. the voice of at least one person, in a vehicle cabin during outputting an audio signal in the or a vehicle cabin via the at least one audio outputting device. The receiving of the human voice in the vehicle cabin via the at least one audio receiving device may thus, take place simultaneously with outputting an audio signal in the vehicle cabin via the at least one audio outputting device.

This simultaneous outputting of audio signals in the or a vehicle cabin and receiving of human voices in the or a vehicle cabin may form basis for implementing special operational modes, such as Karaoke-modes, with the apparatus. As will be more apparent from below, the one or more audio receiving elements may also be arrangeable or arranged so as to receive noise, particularly noise from an external noise source, acoustically perceivable in the or a vehicle cabin and/or receive undesired noise in the or a vehicle cabin, particularly acoustic feedback, generated by receiving an audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin via the at least one audio receiving device.

The apparatus further comprises at least one hardware- and/or software-embodied processing device, particularly a signal processing device, configured to combine, e.g. by audio mixing, the audio signal which is to be output or output in the or a vehicle cabin and the received human voice signal so as to generate a combined audio signal containing the audio signal and the received human voice signal. The combined audio signal is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin of the or a vehicle via the at least one audio outputting device. The processing device thus, allows for generating a combined audio signal which comprises both audio content of an actual audio signal and a received human voice signal. In other words, the combined audio signal allows for simultaneously outputting the audio signal, e.g. a musical piece, and the received human voice signal, e.g. the voice of a person singing along the audio signal. As a result, special operational modes, i.e. particularly a Karaoke mode, can be implemented.

The at least one audio outputting device is thus, configured to output a respective combined audio signal in the or a vehicle cabin. Outputting the combined audio signal in the or a vehicle cabin typically, means that the audio signal, which can be modified as will be explained in more detail below, and the received human voice signal, which can be modified as will be explained in more detail below, are simultaneously output in the or a vehicle cabin. The at least one audio outputting device may thus, be configured to output, in a vehicle cabin, a respective combined audio signal, i.e. an audio signal comprising at least one audio signal component, e.g. a musical piece, containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice, and a received human voice signal of at least one person singing along the audio signal in the or a vehicle cabin.

As the one or more audio outputting elements and the at least one audio outputting device, respectively as well as the one or more audio receiving elements and the at least one audio receiving device, respectively can be standard components of vehicle audio system, the apparatus allows for implementing respective special operational modes, i.e. particularly a Karaoke-mode, with standard components of a vehicle audio system. As such, respective special operational modes, i.e. particularly a Karaoke-mode, can be implemented in easy and reliable manner without providing special external hardware.

The processing device or a hardware- and/or software-embodied suppressing device assignable or assigned to the processing device may be configured to suppress an audio signal component containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice, in an audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin. The processing device or the suppressing device may thus, (also) be deemed or denoted as a vocal suppressor. As such, as indicated above, the audio signal can be modified. Modifying an audio signal can particularly, be implemented by suppressing the or at least one audio signal component which contains a human voice, particularly a singer's voice. As a consequence, the combined audio signal can comprise a modified audio signal, i.e. particularly an audio signal with suppression of the (original) audio signal component containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice. Put briefly, the processing device is configured to generate a modified audio signal which differs from an original audio signal by a suppression of the audio signal component which contains a human voice, particularly a singer's voice. The suppressing device may be embodied as or comprise one or more suitable filter devices.

The processing device or the suppression device may be configured to suppress a respective audio signal component containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice, with a pre-definable or pre-defined dynamic or static suppression level. Thereby, a suppression level of 0% means no suppression of the respective audio signal component such that the audio signal is output with no suppression of the respective audio signal component and a suppression level of 100% means complete suppression of the audio signal component such that the audio signal is output with complete suppression of the respective audio signal component. In other words, suppression either results in reducing the energy level, i.e. particularly a volume level, of the respective audio signal component or (completely) cancelling the respective audio signal component. In either case, suppressing a respective audio signal component typically, results in a clearer output result of a received human voice signal and thus, a clearer acoustic perceivability of the received human voice signal.

Suppressing an audio signal component containing the human voice may require determining and/or extracting the respective audio signal component containing the human voice which is to be suppressed in the audio signal. The processing device or the suppressing device may thus, be configured to determine and/or extract the respective audio signal component which is to be suppressed in the audio signal or from the audio signal, respectively. This determination and/or extraction may be realized by analyzing the acoustic properties, e.g. the frequency spectrum, of the audio signal with regard to (characteristic) acoustic properties, e.g. a specific frequency range, which can be assigned to the audio signal component containing the human voice, e.g. the singer's voice, and/or which can be distinguished from audio signal components not containing the human voice, e.g. containing instruments. Particularly, the processing device or the suppressing device may be configured to extract an audio signal component containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice, from an audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin and to separate an extracted audio signal component containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice, from other audio signal components not containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice, of the respective audio signal. Once determined and/or extracted in respective manner, the audio signal component containing the or a human voice may be suppressed as specified above.

The processing device may be configured to extract the respective audio signal component from the audio signal via splitting of the audio signal in a plurality of audio signal components. Thereby, one audio signal component obtained via splitting the audio signal in the plurality of audio signal components represents the audio signal component which contains the or a human voice, particularly the singer's voice. Splitting of the audio signal may comprise analyzing the audio signal with regard to the respective audio signal component which is to be split from other audio signal components not containing the or a human voice, particularly a singer's voice. The analysis of the audio signal can be performed on basis of pre-definable or pre-defined acoustic properties, e.g. amplitude and/or frequency, of audio signal components containing the or a human voice, particularly a singer's voice.

Additionally or alternatively, the processing device or a hardware- and/or software-embodied splitting device assignable or assigned to the processing device may be configured to split the audio signal in a plurality of audio signal components so as to obtain at least a center signal component, a left signal component, and a right signal component. The center signal component is the or a component of the audio signal which represents the or an audio signal component which is acoustically perceived by a person as being output from a center direction and/or center position of the at least one audio outputting device comprising a left audio output channel and a right audio output channel. The left signal component is the or a component of the audio signal which represents an audio signal component which is acoustically perceived by a person as being output from a (more) left direction and/or left position with respect to a center direction and/or center position of the at least one audio outputting device comprising a left audio output channel and a right audio output channel. The right signal component is the or a component of the audio signal which represents an audio signal component which is acoustically perceived by a person as being output from a (more) right direction and/or right position with respect to a center direction and/or center position of the at least one audio outputting device comprising a left audio output channel and a right audio output channel.

A respective splitting up of the audio signal in a respective center signal component, a left signal component, and a right signal component is based on the insight that the center component typically, contains the human voice, particularly the singer's voice. Hence, when obtaining the center component, one typically also obtains the audio signal component which contains the human voice, particularly the singer's voice.

In this case, the audio signal is typically, a stereo signal comprising a left and a right audio signal component.

The at least one audio receiving device may be configured to receive a human voice signal of at least one first person located in the or a vehicle cabin and a human voice signal of at least one further person located in the or a vehicle cabin. Thereby, the at least one processing device may be further configured to modify the received human voice signal of the at least one first person located in the or a vehicle cabin with at least one first acoustic modification parameter and to modify the received human voice signal of the at least one further person located in the or a vehicle cabin with at least one further acoustic modification parameter. It may be required to separate the received human voice signal of at least one first person, which embraces also a group of first persons, from the received human voice signal of at least one further person, which embraces also a group of further persons, for processing the respective received human voice signals differently. Examples for different processing of respective received human voice signals are varying pitch and/or adding reverberation differently.

The at least one audio receiving device may be configured to receive a human voice signal of at least one first person, e.g. the driver, co-driver, etc., located in the or a vehicle cabin and a human voice signal of at least one further person located in the or a vehicle cabin. Thereby, the processing device or a suppressing device assignable or assigned to the processing device may be further configured to suppress the received human voice signal of the at least one further person located in the vehicle cabin and to generate a resulting received human voice signal which contains (only) the human voice signal of the at least one first person and a suppressed human voice signal of the at least one further person. As such, the received human voice of at least one first person, which embraces also a group of first persons, may be separated from the received voice of at least one further person, which embraces also a group of further persons, by suppressing the received human voice signal of the at least one further person. The suppression of the received human voice signal of the at least one further person may be performed with dynamic or static suppression levels ranging from 100% (complete suppression) to 0% (no suppression). Suppressing the received human voice signals of the at least one further person may require separating the human voice signals of the at least one further person from the human voice signals of the at least one first person or vice versa. In this regard, the above annotations regarding the determination and/or extraction of specific audio signal components from an audio signal apply in analogous manner. The suppressing device may be embodied as or comprise one or more suitable filter devices.

Enabling different received human voice signals to be processed and/or suppressed differently, and output from different audio outputting elements, e.g. loudspeakers, can increase “excitement” in a Karaoke mode of the apparatus. When there are multiple audio receiving elements, e.g. microphones, it could be useful to automatically select the audio receiving element receiving, e.g. the clearest human voice signal, and mute the other audio receiving elements—this can be deemed as a form of noise suppression. Further, multiple received human voice signals can be processed and summed into one signal, so as to boost voice and suppress noise—can be deemed as microphone beamforming.

The at least one audio receiving device may be configured to receive a human voice signal of at least one person located in the or a vehicle cabin and noise, particularly noise from an external noise source i.e. particularly a noise source outside the or a vehicle cabin or outside the vehicle, acoustically perceivable in the or a vehicle cabin. Thereby, the processing device or a suppressing device assignable or assigned to the processing device may be configured to suppress the noise acoustically perceivable in the or a vehicle cabin and to generate a resulting received human voice signal which contains the human voice signal of the at least one person and suppressed noise. As such, the received human voice of a person may be separated from received signals of e.g. an external noise source acoustically perceivable in the or a vehicle cabin. The suppression of the signals of the received noise acoustically perceivable in the or a vehicle cabin may be performed with dynamic or static suppression levels ranging from 100% (complete suppression) to 0% (no suppression). Suppressing the signals of the received noise acoustically perceivable in the or a vehicle cabin may require separating the human voice signals from the signals of the received noise acoustically perceivable in the or a vehicle cabin or vice versa. In this regard, the above annotations regarding the determination and/or extraction of specific audio signal components from an audio signal apply in analogous manner. The suppressing device may be embodied as or comprise one or more suitable filter devices.

The processing device or a hardware- and/or software-embodied suppressing device assignable or assigned to the processing device may be additionally or alternatively configured to suppress undesired noise in the or a vehicle cabin, particularly acoustic feedback, generated by receiving the audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin via the at least one audio outputting device. As such, undesired noise in the or a vehicle cabin, particularly acoustic feedback, generated by receiving the audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin via the at least one audio outputting device can be suppressed. The suppression of the undesired noise generated by receiving the audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin via the at least one audio outputting device can be performed with dynamic or static suppression levels ranging from 100% (complete suppression) to 0% (no suppression). Suppressing the signals of the undesired noise generated by receiving the audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin may require separating the human voice signals from the undesired noise signals generated by receiving the audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin or vice versa. In this regard, the above annotations regarding the determination and/or extraction of specific audio signal components from an audio signal apply in analogous manner. The suppressing device may be embodied as or comprise one or more suitable filter devices.

The processing device or a hardware- and/or software-embodied modifying device assignable or assigned to the processing device may further be configured to modify at least one acoustically perceivable parameter, particularly the pitch and/or the reverberation, of at least one audio signal component of the audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin, particularly an audio signal component containing a human voice, particularly a singer's voice, and/or configured to modify at least one acoustically perceivable parameter, particularly the pitch and/or the reverberation, of the or a received human voice signal of at least one person in the or a vehicle cabin. The processing device or the modifying device may thus, (also) deemed or denoted as a sound enhancer. Modifying acoustically perceivable parameters, such as the pitch and/or the reverberation, of a respective audio signal component and/or a respective received human voice signal allows for concertedly adjusting the acoustically perceivable parameters of a respective combined audio signal and thus, the acoustic playback situation in the or a vehicle cabin which may be useful for implementing special operational modes such as a Karaoke-mode, for instance. As an example, the received human voice signal of a singing person may be acoustically adapted to the musical piece the person sings along by varying pitch and/or adding reverberation or vice versa.

Modifying of at least one acoustically perceivable parameter, particularly the pitch and/or the reverberation, of at least one audio signal component of the audio signal which is outputtable or output in the or a vehicle cabin may also require determining and/or extracting the respective audio signal component which is to be modified. In this regard, the above annotations regarding the determination and/or extraction of specific audio signal components from an audio signal apply in analogous manner. The same applies to modifying of at least one acoustically perceivable parameter, particularly the pitch and/or the reverberation, of a received human voice signal.

The at least one audio receiving device may be built as or may comprise at least one mobile, particularly hand-held, audio receiving element. A respective mobile audio receiving element may be embodied as a mobile, particularly hand-held, microphone. A mobile microphone can be embodied as a wired microphone or a wireless microphone.

At least one mobile audio receiving element may be assignable or assigned to at least one person seat in the or a vehicle cabin. Hence, the apparatus may distinguish received human person voices based on the assignment of the respective audio receiving elements to the respective person seats in the or a vehicle cabin.

It is also conceivable case that the at least one audio receiving device comprises a plurality of mobile, particularly hand-held, audio receiving elements, whereby the receiving level of the respective mobile audio receiving elements is individually adjustable. As such, signals representing at least one main voice and signals representing at least one subsidiary voice can be implemented.

It is also conceivable that microphones provided with mobile terminals, e.g. smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, notebooks, etc., of at least one person could be used a mobile audio receiving element. In this case, a respective mobile terminal needs to be connected with the apparatus which can be achieved by a wired or wireless connection. As an example, Bluetooth- or WIFI-connections could be established in the or a vehicle cabin.

A second aspect of the invention refers to a hardware- and/or software-embodied processing device for an apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention. The processing device is configured to combine, e.g. to mix, an audio signal and a received human voice signal so as to generate a combined audio signal containing the audio signal and the received human voice signal which is outputtable in the or a vehicle cabin via at least one audio outputting device.

All annotations regarding the apparatus of the first aspect of the invention apply mutatis mutandis to the processing device of the second aspect of the invention.

12055021	"BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

1. Field of the Disclosure

The present disclosure relates to electric submersible pumps used in hydrocarbon development operations, and more specifically, the disclosure relates to an inverted electric submersible pump completion with a sand shield.

2. Description of the Related Art

In hydrocarbon developments, it is common practice to use electric submersible pumping systems (ESPs) as a primary form of artificial lift. As an example tubing-deployed inverted ESPs installed between an uphole packer and downhole packer, or through-tubing cable deployed ESP systems which sting into a polished bore receptacle can be used to provide artificial lift. During pump shutdown, sand and other solids in the wellbore can travel in a downhole direction due to the reduction in pressure. Sand and other solids can enter the pump discharge and fall back through the pump section of the inverted ESP.

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

Sand falling back through the pump section of the inverted ESP system is detrimental to the operation of an ESP system over repeated periods of shutdown during production. Systems and methods of this disclosure prevent sand and other solids that are traveling downhole from entering the discharge of the pump section of an inverted ESP system when the pump is shut down.

When the pump is shut down, an operator may deliver fluids from the surface to a location downhole of the ESP system. Such fluids have the potential to be detrimental to certain pump components. Embodiments of this disclosure also prevent fluids that are purposefully pumped downhole from entering the discharge of the pump section and traveling through the pump section of the ESP system.

In an embodiment of this disclosure, a system for providing artificial lift to wellbore fluids includes a pump located within a wellbore. The pump is oriented to selectively boost a pressure of the wellbore fluids traveling from the wellbore towards an earth's surface through a production tubular. A motor is located within the wellbore uphole of the pump and providing power to the pump. A protector assembly is located between the pump and the motor. The pump, the motor, and the protector assembly form an electric submersible pump system. A downhole packer is located within the wellbore downhole of the pump. The downhole packer seals an annular space between an outer diameter surface of the electric submersible pump system and an inner diameter of the wellbore. A solids isolator is located between the pump and the protector assembly. The solids isolator includes a tubular discharge body with an inner discharge bore having a central axis. A body port extends through a sidewall of the discharge body. A sliding seal member is located within the discharge bore. The sliding seal member is moveable between a port open position where the body port is open to allow fluids to travel through the body port between the discharge bore and an outside of the electric submersible pump system, and a port closed position where fluids are prevented from traveling through the body port between the discharge bore and the outside of the electric submersible pump system. The sliding seal member is ring shaped in cross section. The sliding seal member is biased to the port closed position when the pump is off and the sliding seal member is moveable to the port open position when the pump is on.

In alternate embodiments, the system can further include a biasing member, the biasing member positioned to bias the sliding seal member towards the port closed position. The sliding seal member can further include a counter pressure member. The counter pressure member is oriented so that when the pump is on, a force on the counter pressure member overrides a force of the biasing member, moving the sliding seal member towards the port open position.

In other alternate embodiments, the system can include a sand diverter located downhole of the pump and having a flow port assembly located uphole of the downhole packer. The sand diverter can have a diverter inner bore in fluid communication with the wellbore downhole of the downhole packer. The flow port assembly can have an inner sleeve that is moveable between an open position where an inner sleeve port assembly is aligned with an outer sleeve port assembly of an outer sleeve, and a closed position where the inner sleeve port assembly is misaligned with the outer sleeve port assembly.

In yet other alternate embodiments, the tubular discharge body can have a housing head that has a tubular lip that extends axially within the discharge bore. The solids isolator can further include an inner seal that seals between an outer diameter surface of the tubular lip of the housing head and an inner diameter surface of the sliding seal member. An outer seal can seal between an outer diameter surface of the sliding seal member and an inner diameter surface of the discharge bore.

In still other alternate embodiments, the system can further include a shaft extending between the motor and the pump, the shaft extending along the central axis of the discharge body. The solids isolator can further include a downhole bearing supporting the shaft within the discharge bore of the discharge body downhole of the sliding seal member, and an uphole bearing supporting the shaft within the discharge bore of the discharge body uphole of the sliding seal member. The discharge body can alternately further include an uphole end that has an end cap. The end cap can circumscribe the shaft and sealing across the discharge bore. An uphole rotary seal can seal between the shaft and a central opening of the end cap. The discharge body can have a downhole end that is open.

In other alternate embodiments, the discharge body can include a plurality of the body ports and the sliding seal member can include a plurality of inner ports. When the sliding seal member is in the port open position, the body ports can be aligned with the inner ports. Alternately, the sliding seal member can include a traveling ring. The traveling ring can be located downhole of the body port when the sliding seal member is in the port closed position. The traveling ring can be located uphole of the body port when the sliding seal member is in the port open position. The solids isolator can further include a check valve. The check valve can be oriented to allow fluids to travel from the discharge bore to the outside of the electric submersible pump system, and to prevent fluids from traveling from the outside of the electric submersible pump system to inside the discharge bore. The check valve can be located uphole of the traveling ring.

In other embodiments of this disclosure, a method for providing artificial lift to wellbore fluids includes locating a pump within a wellbore. The pump is operable to selectively boost a pressure of the wellbore fluids traveling from the wellbore towards an earth's surface through a production tubular. A motor is located within the wellbore uphole of the pump. The motor provides power to the pump. A protector assembly is located between the pump and the motor. The pump, the motor, and the protector assembly form an electric submersible pump system. A downhole packer is located within the wellbore downhole of the pump. The downhole packer seals an annular space between an outer diameter surface of the electric submersible pump system and an inner diameter of the wellbore. A solids isolator is located between the pump and the protector assembly. The solids isolator includes a tubular discharge body with an inner discharge bore having a central axis. A body port extends through a sidewall of the discharge body. A sliding seal member is located within the discharge bore. The sliding seal member is moveable between a port open position where the body port is open to allow fluids to travel through the body port between the discharge bore and an outside of the electric submersible pump system, and a port closed position where fluids are prevented from traveling through the body port between the discharge bore and the outside of the electric submersible pump system. The sliding seal member is ring shaped in cross section. The sliding seal member moves to the port closed position when the pump is off. The sliding seal member moves to the port open position when the pump is on.

In alternate embodiments, a biasing member can be positioned to bias the sliding seal member towards the port closed position. The sliding seal member can further include a counter pressure member and the method can further include moving the sliding seal member towards the port open position when the pump is on with a fluid force applied to the counter pressure member that overrides the force of the biasing member. A sand diverter can be located downhole of the pump and having a flow port assembly located uphole of the downhole packer. The sand diverter can have a diverter inner bore in fluid communication with the wellbore downhole of the downhole packer. The method can further include moving an inner sleeve of the flow port assembly between an open position where an inner sleeve port assembly is aligned with an outer sleeve port assembly of an outer sleeve, and a closed position where the inner sleeve port assembly is misaligned with the outer sleeve port assembly.

In other alternate embodiments, the tubular discharge body can have a housing head that has a tubular lip that extends axially within the discharge bore. The method can further include sealing between an outer diameter surface of the tubular lip of the housing head and an inner diameter surface of the sliding seal member with an inner seal, and sealing between an outer diameter surface of the sliding seal member and an inner diameter surface of the discharge bore with an outer seal.

In yet other alternate embodiments, a shaft can extend between the motor and the pump, the shaft extending along the central axis of the discharge body. The method can further include supporting the shaft within the discharge bore of the discharge body downhole of the sliding seal member with a downhole bearing, and supporting the shaft within the discharge bore of the discharge body uphole of the sliding seal member with an uphole bearing. The discharge body can further include an uphole end that has an end cap, the end cap circumscribing the shaft and sealing across the discharge bore and an uphole rotary seal that seals between the shaft and a central opening of the end cap. The discharge body can have a downhole end that is open.

In still other alternate embodiments, the discharge body can include a plurality of the body ports and the sliding seal member can include a plurality of inner ports. The method can further include aligning the inner ports with the body ports when the sliding seal member is in the port open position. Alternately, the sliding seal member can include a traveling ring and the method can further include positioning the traveling ring downhole of the body port when the sliding seal member is in the port closed position, and positioning the traveling ring uphole of the body port when the sliding seal member is in the port open position. A check valve can be located uphole of the traveling ring. The check valve can be oriented to allow fluids to travel from the discharge bore to the outside of the electric submersible pump system, and to prevent fluids from traveling from the outside of the electric submersible pump system to inside the discharge bore.

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to associating physical spaces with Internet addresses, and more particularly registering geofences and/or GPS coordinates with an anchor point determined using an IP address.

2. Description of the Prior Art

Systems, methods, and devices for creating databases of land are well-known in the prior art. It is also known to have an IP address associated with a general location, such as a city or zip code. Furthermore, location-based beacon technologies have entered the mass markets providing geo-location and enabling of portable wireless devices for venue and in-store customer marketing, sales and CRM services. Real estate ownership and the management of business services within the constraints of the business space, like a mall or convention center, has become open game for outside competitive customer poaching and other kinds of interference. Furthermore, geo-fencing could address other contentious applications and their use, such as texting while driving. Ubiquitous smartphone usage and location based mobile marketing and communication have become prevalent in today's society. With 1.75 billion smartphone users in 2014 and 85% of the top 100 retailers estimated to be using beacon technology by 2016, opportunities for determining the interactions of the smartphones, beacons, and the Internet generally within defined spaces are numerous.

Exemplary US Patent documents in the prior art include:

US Pub.

11910916	"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to fixtures for supporting devices when the user is in a supine position and, more particularly, to an articulated support stand that may be attached to a bed rail or the like.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Computers are used in many different surroundings, such as homes, schools, medical institutions and other types of businesses. There are times when computers and other electronic devices such as phones, tablets, etc. are used by an individual that is sitting in bed (or in a relatively supine position in bed). In some cases, it is difficult to find a comfortable position for performing computer-related tasks while also balancing a computer, laptop, tablet, etc. People with limited dexterity may find it difficult to use their devices while trying to maintain balance. Simply stated, there are ergonomic issues involved with people using their electronic devices in bed.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The needs remaining in the prior art are addressed by the present invention, which relates to fixtures for supporting devices when the user is in a supine position and, more particularly, to an articulated support stand that may be attached to a bed rail or the like.

In accordance with the present invention, a support fixture is provided that may be removably clamped to a bed rail (or any other support rail) and includes a lower support arm attached to the removable clamp through a rotatable connector. An upper support arm is attached to a distal termination of the lower support arm via a pivot connector. The combination of the lower and upper arms is referred to at times as an articulated arm assembly. A device support member is coupled to the upper support arm via a multi-stage gimbal system, perhaps in combination with a quick-release connection (allowing for the device support component to be used as a stand-alone fixture).

In various embodiments, the clamp may include pairs of rotatable scissor arms that grasp the inner and outer surfaces of a support rail. The clamp may further comprise a locking knob that is utilized to maintain the pairs of rotatable scissor arms in place once mounted onto the support rail.

Some embodiments may include a lower arm that is connected to the clamp through a fixture that allows for the lower arm to be foldable, extendable and rotatable. That is, the coupling between the clamp and the lower arm is configured to allow the lower arm to rotate and swing from a horizontal to vertical position (with respect to the support rail). The horizontal motion is preferable fully encompassing motion from −90 degrees to +90 degrees with respect to the vertical position.

A device holder component in various embodiments includes a pair of side grippers for holding, for example, an electronic device in place, particularly by engaging with opposing side edges of the electronic device (or any other object of the user's choice). At least one of the side grippers may be extendable so as to accommodate the use of relatively wide devices. The device holder may also include one or more fold-up dividers that are used to enable the single device holder to fixedly support multiple electronic devices (e.g., a tablet and a phone). For added flexibility, a quick release feature may be included in the connection between the device holder to the upper arm, allowing for the device holder to be dis-engaged from the remaining elements of the fixture in certain situations. The ability to completely remove the device holder from the other elements of the fixture allows for the device holder to become a device stand, for example, or used on a monitor arm mount (for example) via an industry standard type of bracket (e.g., a VESA plate).

An exemplary embodiment of the present invention may take the form of a support fixture for use with electronic devices, where the support fixture includes, a clamp, an articulated arm assembly, and a device support component. The clamp includes a pair of possibly spring-loaded scissor arms coupled together at a central pivot point, the crossing of the pair of scissor arms creating a set of four arm portions that pivot in a manner to grasp top and bottom surfaces of a support member. The clamp further comprises a locking mechanism including a locking knob and a drive screw fixed to an interior of the locking knob and having a locking nut disposed on the drive screw, where the locking knob is disposed such that the drive screw is positioned in the vertical direction below the pivot point, with the rotation of the locking knob causing the locking nut to move vertically along the drive screw toward the central pivot point, fixing the pair of scissor arms in place upon being positioned on the support member. The articulated arm assembly includes an arm assembly bracket (disposed over the clamp and including an opening disposed along the vertical axis of the clamp), a lower arm that includes a pivot joint member at a proximal termination for attaching the lower arm to the arm assembly bracket (the pivot joint member enabling the lower arm to rotate between vertical and horizontal positionings), and an upper arm coupled to a distal termination of the lower arm through a multi-position joint coupling, the upper arm further comprising a multi-stage gimbal system disposed at the distal termination thereof. The device support component is coupled to the upper arm through the multi-stage gimbal, enabling rotational and yaw movements with respect to the upper arm, the device support component having a main body deck and a pair of gripping arms disposed along opposite terminations thereof, the pair of gripping arms used for securing edges of an electronic device to the support fixture.

Another embodiment of the present invention is configured to comprise a clamp component including a pair of scissor arms coupled together at a central pivot point, the crossing of the pair of scissor arms creating a set of four arm portions that pivot in a manner to grasp top and bottom surfaces of the (typically horizontal) support member, and a locking mechanism including a locking knob and a drive screw fixed to an interior of the locking knob and having a locking nut disposed on the drive screw, wherein the locking knob is disposed such that the drive screw is positioned in the longitudinal direction below the pivot point with the rotation of the locking knob causing the locking nut to move longitudinally along the drive screw toward the central pivot point.

Yet another embodiment of the present invention may comprise an articulated arm assembly including a clamp, an arm assembly bracket disposed over the clamp and including an opening disposed along the vertical axis of the clamp, a lower arm, including a pivot joint member at a proximal termination for attaching the lower arm to the arm assembly bracket (the pivot joint member enabling the lower arm to rotate between vertical and horizontal positions, a typically horizontal position bringing the lower arm in proximity to the clamp as used in a stowed position), and an upper arm coupled to a distal termination of the lower arm through an upper arm pivot joint coupling.

A further embodiment of the present invention is directed to device holder component for use in supporting at least one communication device. In particular, the device holder component includes a main body deck, a pair of side grippers disposed along opposite terminations of the main body deck and used for securing edges of the at least one communication device to the device holder component, and an angled support bracket attached to a lower surface of the main body deck and positioned such that a computer keyboard may be disposed on the angled support bracket.

Other and further aspects and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent during the course of the following discussion and by reference to the accompanying drawings.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to systems, methods and computer program readable medium providing a secure electronic intermediary service between financial statement providers, their clients and the users of the financial statements (i.e. lending institutions, investors, business partners, etc.) to reduce time, resources, and costs necessary to confirm financial statements.

When a business or individual applies to borrow money from a lending institution (e.g., a bank), the lending institution typically requires financial statements from the business. The borrower (i.e. the Client) must typically provide financial statements such as a balance sheet, a tax return, and an income statement to the lending institution. Items on the financial statements include, but are not limited to: assets, debt, receivables, payables, investments and transaction details. These financial statements may be but are not necessarily audited, compiled, reviewed and/or prepared financial statements by the financial statement providers which can include Certified Public Accounting Firms, Chartered Accountants, and Tax Preparers. The conventional practice is for the lender to receive financial statements prepared by a certified public accountant (CPA) in the relevant jurisdiction from the CPA or from a principal/partner at the business.

The conventional approach presents several problems. The financial statements are provided to the financial statement users (i.e., lending institutions) by the client and do not come directly from the financial statement providers to the financial statement users and because financial statement confirmation is a time and resource intensive process, the lending institution may not confirm the accuracy and/or validity of the financial statements with the CPA that generated the financial statements. This creates opportunities for an unscrupulous client (i.e. borrower, individual or company) to fabricate the financial statements while either signing the name of a legitimate financial statement provider or altering the information in the financial statements without the financial statement provider's knowledge, and then providing those misleading and falsified financial statements to the financial statement users. Also, the lending institution may not realize the license status or lack of a valid license of the individual CPA, CPA firm, or entity purporting to be a CPA firm that generated the financial statements. Thus, the financial statement provider may be operating on a fake license, an expired license, or an entirely fabricated license which can, for example, cause problems with loan insurance payouts if the resulting loan goes into default.

Financial statement users such as lending institutions vary in how and if they confirm financial statement information, though larger lending institutions have one or more centers devoted solely to processing financial statement information. Additional costs are incurred when the employees work overtime and/or employ temporary staffing to meet the demand needed to process the financial statement information. Further, manually confirming the information in the financial statements and the validity of the financial statement provider takes a significant amount of time (e.g., a week or more) which results in lost time and revenue to the lending institution and a delay in obtaining a loan to the business (i.e., client). Financial statement users such as investors may invest in businesses or in people based on their belief that the financial statements provided by the client are legitimate and that they were created by an appropriately certified and/or licensed individual and/or firm.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

According to one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for confirming the license status and identity of a purported financial statement provider (i.e., certified public accountant (CPA), CPA firm, or other such entity) preparing financial statements for the client which is in turn provided to a financial statement user such as a lending institution on behalf of a business or individual applying for a loan. The financial statements must be provided to the lending institution by the business (i.e., client) applying for a loan according to existing financial regulations. Because financial statements may only be released by the business, the confirmation system allows financial statements provided from a financial statement provider to be provided to a financial statement user unaltered under permissions set by the client and with approval by the client via the confirmation system. In some embodiments, the financial statement provider (e.g., accountant) can verify the veracity of the financial statements before they are ultimately provided to the financial statement user (e.g., lending institution) either by providing the financial statements to the confirmation system, or by approving the financial statements after they are uploaded to the confirmation system by the client. Optionally, the method includes confirming financial information in financial statements submitted to a lending institution by a business applying for a loan from the lending institution.

In another aspect of the invention, a method of obtaining accountant prepared financial statements associated with a client includes receiving, via a communications network, an identity of a client from a financial statement user. An identity of an accountant is received from a client via the communications network. Financial statements associated with the client are received from the identified accountant via the communications network. The received financial statements include financial information associated with the client. Permissions associated with the financial statements are received from the client via the communications network. The financial statements are provided via the communications network to the financial statement user in accordance with the permissions provided by the client.

In the late 1800's, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. The conventional light bulb, commonly called the “Edison bulb,” has been used for over one hundred years for a variety of applications including lighting and displays. The conventional light bulb uses a tungsten filament enclosed in a glass bulb sealed in a base, which is screwed into a socket. The socket is coupled to an AC power or DC power source. The conventional light bulb can be found commonly in houses, buildings, and outdoor lightings, and other areas requiring light or displays. Unfortunately, drawbacks exist with the conventional light bulb:The conventional light bulb dissipates more than 90% of the energy used as thermal energy.The conventional light bulb routinely fails due to thermal expansion and contraction of the filament element.The conventional light bulb emits light over a broad spectrum, much of which is not perceived by the human eye.The conventional light bulb emits in all directions, which is undesirable for applications requiring strong directionality or focus, e.g. projection displays, optical data storage, etc.

To overcome some of the drawbacks of the conventional light bulb, fluorescent lighting has been developed. Fluorescent lighting uses an optically clear tube structure filled with a halogen gas and, which typically also contains mercury. A pair of electrodes is coupled between the halogen gas and couples to an alternating power source through a ballast. Once the gas has been excited, it discharges to emit light. Typically, the optically clear tube is coated with phosphors, which are excited by the light. Many building structures use fluorescent lighting and, more recently, fluorescent lighting has been fitted onto a base structure, which couples into a standard socket.

Due to the high efficiency, long lifetimes, low cost, and non-toxicity offered by solid state lighting technology, light emitting diodes (LED) have rapidly emerged as the illumination technology of choice. An LED is a two-lead semiconductor light source typically based on a p-i-n junction diode, which emits electromagnetic radiation when activated. The emission from an LED is spontaneous and is typically in a Lambertian pattern. When a suitable voltage is applied to the leads, electrons and holes recombine within the device releasing energy in the form of photons. This effect is called electroluminescence, and the color of the light is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor.

Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962 the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity infrared light. Infrared LEDs are still frequently used as transmitting elements in remote-control circuits, such as those in remote controls for a wide variety of consumer electronics. The first visible-light LEDs were also of low intensity, and limited to red. Modern LEDs are available across the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with very high brightness.

The earliest blue and violet gallium nitride (GaN)-based LEDs were fabricated using a metal-insulator-semiconductor structure due to a lack of p-type GaN. The first p-n junction GaN LED was demonstrated by Amano et al. using the LEEBI treatment to obtain p-type GaN in 1989. They obtained the current-voltage (I-V) curve and electroluminescence of the LEDs, but did not record the output power or the efficiency of the LEDs. Nakamura et al. demonstrated the p-n junction GaN LED using the low-temperature GaN buffer and the LEEBI treatment in 1991 with an output power of 42 μW at 20 mA. The first p-GaN/n-InGaN/n-GaN DH blue LEDs were demonstrated by Nakamura et al. in 1993. The LED showed a strong band-edge emission of InGaN in a blue wavelength regime with an emission wavelength of 440 nm under a forward biased condition. The output power and the EQE were 125 μW and 0.22%, respectively, at a forward current of 20 mA. In 1994, Nakamura et al. demonstrated commercially available blue LEDs with an output power of 1.5 mW, an EQE of 2.7%, and the emission wavelength of 450 nm. On Oct. 7, 2014, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura for “the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources” or, less formally, LED lamps.

By combining GaN-based LEDs with wavelength converting materials such as phosphors, solid-state white light sources were realized. This technology utilizing GaN-based LEDs and phosphor materials to produce white light is now illuminating the world around us as a result of the many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. Light-emitting diodes are now used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting, automotive headlamps, advertising, general lighting, traffic signals, and camera flashes. LEDs have allowed new text, video displays, and sensors to be developed, while their high switching rates are also useful in advanced communications technology.

Although useful, LEDs still have limitations that are desirable to overcome in accordance to the inventions described in the following disclosure.

SUMMARY

The present invention provides a device and method for an integrated white colored electromagnetic radiation source using a combination of laser diode excitation sources based on gallium and nitrogen containing materials and light emitting source based on phosphor materials. In this invention a violet, blue, or other wavelength laser diode source based on gallium and nitrogen materials is closely integrated with phosphor materials, such as yellow phosphors configured with designated scattering centers on an excitation surface or inside a bulk, to form a compact, high-brightness, and highly-efficient, white light source. In an example, the source can be provided for specialized applications, among general applications, and the like.

Additional benefits are achieved over pre-existing techniques using the present invention. In particular, the present invention enables a cost-effective white light source. In a specific embodiment, the present optical device can be manufactured in a relatively simple and cost effective manner. Depending upon the embodiment, the present apparatus and method can be manufactured using conventional materials and/or methods according to one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments of this invention the gallium and nitrogen containing laser diode source is based on c-plane gallium nitride material and in other embodiments the laser diode is based on nonpolar or semipolar gallium and nitride material. In one embodiment the white source is configured from a chip on submount (CoS) with an integrated phosphor on the submount to form a chip and phosphor on submount (CPoS) white light source. In some embodiments the light source and phosphor are configured on a common support member wherein the common support member may be a package member.

In various embodiments, the laser device and phosphor device are mounted on a common support member with or without intermediate submounts and the phosphor materials are operated in a transmissive mode, a reflective mode, or a side-pumped mode to result in a white emitting laser-based light source. Merely by way of example, the invention can be applied to applications such as white lighting, white spot lighting, flash lights, automobile headlights, all-terrain vehicle lighting, flash sources such as camera flashes, light sources used in recreational sports such as biking, surfing, running, racing, boating, light sources used for drones, planes, robots, other mobile or robotic applications, safety, counter measures in defense applications, multi-colored lighting, lighting for flat panels, medical, metrology, beam projectors and other displays, high intensity lamps, spectroscopy, entertainment, theater, music, and concerts, analysis fraud detection and/or authenticating, tools, water treatment, laser dazzlers, targeting, communications, LiFi, visible light communications (VLC), sensing, detecting, distance detecting, Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), transformations, transportations, leveling, curing and other chemical treatments, heating, cutting and/or ablating, pumping other optical devices, other optoelectronic devices and related applications, and source lighting and the like.

Laser diodes are ideal as phosphor excitation sources. With a spatial brightness (optical intensity per unit area) more than 10,000 times higher than conventional LEDs, extreme directionality of the laser emission, and without the droop phenomenon that plagues LEDs, laser diodes enable characteristics unachievable by LEDs and other light sources. Specifically, since the laser diodes output beams carrying over 0.5 W, over 1 W, over 3 W, over 10 W, or even over 100 W can be focused to very small spot sizes of less than 1 mm in diameter, less than 500 microns in diameter, less than 100 microns in diameter, or even less than 50 microns in diameter, power densities of over 1 W/mm2, 100 W/mm2, or even over 2,500 W/mm2can be achieved. When this very small and powerful beam of laser excitation light is incident on a phosphor material an extremely bright spot or point source of white light can be achieved. Assuming a phosphor conversion ratio of 200 lumens of emitted white light per optical watt of excitation light, a 5 W excitation power could generate 1000 lumens in a beam diameter of 100 microns, or 50 microns, or less. This unprecedented source brightness can be game changing in applications such as spotlighting or range finding where parabolic reflectors or lensing optics can be combined with the point source to create highly collimated white light spots that can travel drastically higher distances than ever possible before using LEDs or bulb technology.

In one embodiment, the present invention provides a CPoS laser-based white light source comprising a form factor characterized by a length, a width, and a height. In an example, the height is characterized by a dimension of less than 25 mm, and greater than 0.5 mm, although there may be variations. In an alternative example, the height is characterized by a dimension of less than 12.5 mm, and greater than 0.5 mm, although there may be variations. In yet an alternative example, the length and width are characterized by a dimension of less than 30 mm, less than 15 mm, or less than 5 mm, although there may be variations. The apparatus has a support member and at least one gallium and nitrogen containing laser diode devices and phosphor material overlying the support member. The laser device is capable of an emission of a laser beam with a wavelength preferably in the blue region of 425 nm to 475 nm or in the ultra violet or violet region of 380 nm to 425 nm, but can be other such as in the cyan region of 475 nm to 510 nm or the green region of 510 nm to 560 nm. In some embodiments two or more laser diodes or laser stripes are included in the integrated white light source. Combining multiple laser sources can offer many potential benefits according to this invention. First, the excitation power can be increased by beam combining to provide a more powerful excitation spit and hence produce a brighter light source. Similarly, the reliability of the source can be increased by using multiple sources at lower drive conditions to achieve the same excitation power as a single source driven at more harsh conditions such as higher current and voltage. A second advantage is the potential for a more circular spot by rotating the first free space diverging elliptical laser beam by 90 degrees relative to the second free space diverging elliptical laser beam and overlapping the centered ellipses on the phosphor. Alternatively, a more circular spot can be achieved by rotating the first free space diverging elliptical laser beam by 180 degrees relative to the second free space diverging elliptical laser beam and off-centered overlapping the ellipses on the phosphor to increase spot diameter in slow axis diverging direction. In another configuration, more than 2 lasers are included and some combination of the above described beam shaping spot geometry shaping is achieved. A third and important advantage is that multiple color or wavelength lasers can be included to offer improved performance such as an improved color rendering or color quality. For example, two or more blue excitation lasers with slightly detuned wavelengths (e.g. 5 nm 10 nm, 15 nm, etc.) can be included to create a larger blue spectrum. In one embodiment, separate individual laser chips are configured within the laser-phosphor light source. By positioning multiple laser chips in a predetermined configuration, multiple excitation beams can be overlapped on the phosphor spot to create a more ideal spot geometry. In alternative embodiments, laser diodes with multiple adjacent laser stripes, multi-stripe lasers” are included in the integrated white light source. The multiple stripes can enable an increased excitation power for a brighter light source and/or an improved or modified spot pattern on the phosphor. In a preferred embodiment the phosphor material can provide a yellowish emission in the 550 nm to 590 nm range such that when mixed with the blue emission of the laser diode a white light is produced. In other embodiments, phosphors with red, green, yellow, and even blue emission can be used in combination with the laser diode excitation source to produce a white light with color mixing.

In an embodiment, the device layers comprise a super-luminescent light emitting diode or SLED. A SLED is in many ways similar to an edge emitting laser diode; however, the emitting facet of the device is designed so as to have a very low reflectivity. A SLED is similar to a laser diode as it is based on an electrically driven junction that when injected with current becomes optically active and generates amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and gain over a wide range of wavelengths. When the optical output becomes dominated by ASE there is a knee in the light output versus current (LI) characteristic wherein the unit of light output becomes drastically larger per unit of injected current. This knee in the LI curve resembles the threshold of a laser diode, but is much softer. A SLED would have a layer structure engineered to have a light emitting layer or layers clad above and below with material of lower optical index such that a laterally guided optical mode can be formed. The SLED would also be fabricated with features providing lateral optical confinement. These lateral confinement features may consist of an etched ridge, with air, vacuum, metal or dielectric material surrounding the ridge and providing a low optical-index cladding. The lateral confinement feature may also be provided by shaping the electrical contacts such that injected current is confined to a finite region in the device. In such a “gain guided” structure, dispersion in the optical index of the light emitting layer with injected carrier density provides the optical-index contrast needed to provide lateral confinement of the optical mode. The emission spectral width is typically substantially wider (>5 nm) than that of a laser diode and offer advantages with respect to reduced image distortion in displays, increased eye safety, and enhanced capability in measurement and spectroscopy applications.

SLEDs are designed to have high single pass gain or amplification for the spontaneous emission generated along the waveguide. The SLED device would also be engineered to have a low internal loss, preferably below 1 cm−1, however SLEDs can operate with internal losses higher than this. In the ideal case, the emitting facet reflectivity would be zero, however in practical applications a reflectivity of zero is difficult to achieve and the emitting facet reflectivity is designs to be less than 1%, less than 0.1%, less than 0.001%, or less than 0.0001% reflectivity. Reducing the emitting facet reflectivity reduces feedback into the device cavity, thereby increasing the injected current density at which the device will begin to lase. Very low reflectivity emitting facets can be achieved by a combination of addition of anti-reflection coatings and by angling the emitting facet relative to the SLED cavity such that the surface normal of the facet and the propagation direction of the guided modes are substantially non-parallel. In general, this would mean a deviation of more than 1-2 degrees. In practice, the ideal angle depends in part on the anti-reflection coating used and the tilt angle must be carefully designed around a null in the reflectivity versus angle relationship for optimum performance. Tilting of the facet with respect to the propagation direction of the guided modes can be done in any direction relative to the direction of propagation of the guided modes, though some directions may be easier to fabricate depending on the method of facet formation. Etched facets provide high flexibility for facet angle determination. Alternatively, a very common method to achieve an angled output for reduced constructive interference in the cavity would to curve and/or angle the waveguide with respect to a cleaved facet that forms on a pre-determined crystallographic plane in the semiconductor chip. In this configuration the angle of light propagation is off-normal at a specified angle designed for low reflectivity to the cleaved facet. A low reflectivity facet may also be formed by roughening the emitting facet in such a way that light extraction is enhanced and coupling of reflected light back into the guided modes is limited. SLEDs are applicable to all embodiments according to the present invention and the device can be used interchangeably with laser diode device when applicable.

The apparatus typically has a free space with a non-guided laser beam characteristic transmitting the emission of the laser beam from the laser device to the phosphor material. The laser beam spectral width, wavelength, size, shape, intensity, and polarization are configured to excite the phosphor material. The beam can be configured by positioning it at the precise distance from the phosphor to exploit the beam divergence properties of the laser diode and achieve the desired spot size. In one embodiment, the incident angle from the laser to the phosphor is optimized to achieve a desired beam shape on the phosphor. For example, due to the asymmetry of the laser aperture and the different divergent angles on the fast and slow axis of the beam the spot on the phosphor produced from a laser that is configured normal to the phosphor would be elliptical in shape, typically with the fast axis diameter being larger than the slow axis diameter. To compensate this, the laser beam incident angle on the phosphor can be optimized to stretch the beam in the slow axis direction such that the beam is more circular on phosphor. In alternative embodiments laser diodes with multiple parallel adjacent emitter stripes can be configured to result in a wider and/or more powerful excitation spot on the phosphor. By making the spot wider in the lateral direction the spot could become more circular to the faster divergence angle of the laser emission in the vertical direction. For example, two or more laser stripes may be spaced by 10-30 μm, 30-60 μm, 60-100 μm, or 100-300 μm. In some embodiments the parallel stripes have slightly detuned wavelengths for an improved color quality. In other embodiments free space optics such as collimating lenses can be used to shape the beam prior to incidence on the phosphor. In one example, a re-imaging optic is used to reflect and reshape the beam onto the phosphor member. In an alternative example, the otherwise wasted reflected incident light from the phosphor is recycled with a re-imaging optic by being reflected back to the phosphor.

The excitation beam can be characterized by a polarization purity of greater than 50% and less than 100%. As used herein, the term “polarization purity” means greater than 50% of the emitted electromagnetic radiation is in a substantially similar polarization state such as the transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) polarization states, but can have other meanings consistent with ordinary meaning. In an example, the laser beam incident on the phosphor has a power of less than 0.1 W, greater than 0.1 W, greater than 0.5 W, greater than 1 W, greater than 5 W, greater than 10 W, or greater than 20 W.

The phosphor material can be operated in a transmissive mode, a reflective mode, or a combination of a transmissive mode and reflective mode, or a side-pumped mode, or other modes. The phosphor material is characterized by a conversion efficiency, a resistance to thermal damage, a resistance to optical damage, a thermal quenching characteristic, a porosity to scatter excitation light, and a thermal conductivity. The phosphor may have an intentionally roughened surface to increase the light extraction from the phosphor. In a preferred embodiment the phosphor material is comprised of a yellow emitting YAG material doped with Ce with a conversion efficiency of greater than 100 lumens per optical watt, greater than 200 lumens per optical watt, or greater than 300 lumens per optical watt, and can be a polycrystalline ceramic material or a single crystal material. The white light apparatus also has an electrical input interface configured to couple electrical input power to the laser diode device to generate the laser beam and excite the phosphor material. The white light source configured to produce greater than 1 lumen, 10 lumens, 100 lumens, 250 lumens, 500 lumens, 1000 lumens, 3000 lumens, or 10000 lumens of white light output. The support member is configured to transport thermal energy from the at least one laser diode device and the phosphor material to a heat sink. The support member is configured to provide thermal impedance of less than 10 degrees Celsius per watt or less than 5 degrees Celsius per watt of dissipated power characterizing a thermal path from the laser device to a heat sink. The support member is comprised of a thermally conductive material such as copper, copper tungsten, aluminum, alumina, SiC, sapphire, AlN, or other metals, ceramics, or semiconductors.

In a preferred configuration of this integrated white light source, the common support member comprises the same submount that the gallium and nitrogen containing laser diode chip is directly bonded to. That is, the laser diode chip is mounted down or attached to a submount configured from a material such as SiC, AlN, or diamond and the phosphor material is also mounted to this submount, such that the submount is the common support member. The phosphor material may have an intermediate material positioned between the submount and the phosphor. The intermediate material may be comprised of a thermally conductive material such as copper. The laser diode can be attached to a first surface of the submount using conventional die attaching techniques using solders such as AuSn solder, SAC solder such as SAC305, lead containing solder, or indium, but can be others. In an alternative embodiment sintered Ag pastes or films can be used for the attach process at the interface. Sintered Ag attach material can be dispensed or deposited using standard processing equipment and cycle temperatures with the added benefit of higher thermal conductivity and improved electrical conductivity. For example, AuSn has a thermal conductivity of about 50 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 16 micro-ohm×cm whereas pressureless sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 125 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 4 micro-ohm×cm, or pressured sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 250 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 2.5 micro-ohm×cm. Due to the extreme change in melt temperature from paste to sintered form, (260° C.-900° C.), processes can avoid thermal load restrictions on downstream processes, allowing completed devices to have very good and consistent bonds throughout. Similarly, the phosphor material may be bonded to the submount using a soldering technique, or a sintered Ag technique, but it can be other techniques such as gluing technique or epoxy technique. Optimizing the bond for the lowest thermal impedance is a key parameter for heat dissipation from the phosphor, which is critical to prevent phosphor degradation and thermal quenching of the phosphor material.

In an alternative configuration of this white light source, the laser diode is bonded to an intermediate submount configured between the gallium and nitrogen containing laser chip and the common support member. In this configuration, the intermediate submount can be comprised of SiC, AlN, diamond, or other, and the laser can be attached to a first surface of the submount using conventional die attaching techniques using solders such as AuSn solder, a SAC solder such as SAC305, lead containing solder, or indium, but can be others. In an alternative embodiment sintered Ag pastes or films can be used for the attach process at the interface. Sintered Ag attach material can be dispensed or deposited using standard processing equipment and cycle temperatures with the added benefit of higher thermal conductivity and improved electrical conductivity. For example, AuSn has a thermal conductivity of about 50 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 16 micro-ohm×cm whereas pressureless sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 125 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 4 micro-ohm×cm, or pressured sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 250 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 2.5 micro-ohm×cm. Due to the extreme change in melt temperature from paste to sintered form, (260° C.-900° C.), processes can avoid thermal load restrictions on downstream processes, allowing completed devices to have very good and consistent bonds throughout. The second surface of the submount can be attached to the common support member using similar techniques, but could be others. Similarly, the phosphor material may have an intermediate material or submount positioned between the common support member and the phosphor. The intermediate material may be comprised of a thermally conductive material such as copper or copper tungsten. The phosphor material may be bonded using a soldering technique, a sintered Ag technique, or other technique. In this configuration, the common support member should be configured of a thermally conductive material such as copper or copper tungsten. Optimizing the bond for the lowest thermal impedance is a key parameter for heat dissipation from the phosphor, which is critical to prevent phosphor degradation and thermal quenching of the phosphor material.

In yet another preferred variation of this CPoS integrated white light source, a process for lifting-off gallium and nitrogen containing epitaxial material and transferring it to the common support member can be used to attach the gallium and nitrogen containing laser epitaxial material to a submount member. In this embodiment, the gallium and nitrogen epitaxial material is released from the gallium and nitrogen containing substrate it was epitaxially grown on. As an example, the epitaxial material can be released using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) etching technique. It is then transferred to a submount material using techniques such as wafer bonding wherein a bond interface is formed. For example, the bond interface can be comprised of a Au—Au bond. The submount material preferably has a high thermal conductivity such as SiC, wherein the epitaxial material is subsequently processed to form a laser diode with a cavity member, front and back facets, and electrical contacts for injecting current. After laser fabrication is complete, a phosphor material is introduced onto the submount to form an integrated white light source. The phosphor material may have an intermediate material positioned between the submount and the phosphor. The intermediate material may be comprised of a thermally conductive material such as copper. The phosphor material can be attached to the submount using conventional die attaching techniques using solders such as AuSn solder, SAC solder such as SAC305, lead containing solder, or indium, but can be others. In an alternative embodiment sintered Ag pastes or films can be used for the attach process at the interface. Sintered Ag attach material can be dispensed or deposited using standard processing equipment and cycle temperatures with the added benefit of higher thermal conductivity and improved electrical conductivity. For example, AuSn has a thermal conductivity of about 50 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 16 micro-ohm×cm whereas pressureless sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 125 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 4 micro-ohm×cm, or pressured sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 250 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 2.5 micro-ohm×cm. Due to the extreme change in melt temperature from paste to sintered form, (260° C.-900° C.), processes can avoid thermal load restrictions on downstream processes, allowing completed devices to have very good and consistent bonds throughout. Optimizing the bond for the lowest thermal impedance is a key parameter for heat dissipation from the phosphor, which is critical to prevent phosphor degradation and thermal quenching of the phosphor material. The benefits of using this embodiment with lifted-off and transferred gallium and nitrogen containing material are the reduced cost, improved laser performance, and higher degree of flexibility for integration using this technology.

In all embodiments of this integrated white light source, the present invention may include safety features and design considerations. In any based laser based source, safety is a key aspect. It is critical that the light source cannot be compromised or modified in such a way to create laser diode beam that can be harmful to human beings, animals, or the environment. Thus, the overall design should include safety considerations and features, and in some cases even active components for monitoring. Examples of design considerations and features for safety include positioning the laser beam with respect to the phosphor in a way such that if the phosphor is removed or damaged, the exposed laser beam would not make it to the outside environment in a harmful form such as collimated, coherent beam. More specifically, the white light source is designed such that laser beam is pointing away from the outside environment and toward a surface or feature that will prevent the beam from being reflected to the outside world. In an example of a passive design features for safety include beam dumps and/or absorbing material can be specifically positioned in the location the laser beam would hit in the event of a removed or damaged phosphor. In some embodiments thermal fuses are incorporated wherein the fuse creates an open circuit and turns the laser diode off in an un-safe condition.

In some embodiments of this invention, safety features and systems use active components. Example active components include photodiodes/photodetectors and thermistors. Strategically located detectors designed to detect direct blue emission from the laser, scatter blue emission, or phosphor emission such as yellow phosphor emission can be used to detect failures of the phosphor where a blue beam could be exposed. Upon detection of such an event, a close circuit or feedback loop would be configured to cease power supply to the laser diode and effectively turn it off. As an example, a detector used to detect phosphor emission could be used to determine if the phosphor emission rapidly reduced, which would indicate that the laser is no longer effectively hitting the phosphor for excitation and could mean that the phosphor was removed or damaged. In another example of active safety features, a blue sensitive photodetector could be positioned to detect reflected or scatter blue emission from the laser diode such that if the phosphor was removed or compromised the amount of blue light detected would rapidly increase and the laser would be shut off by the safety system. In yet another example of active safety features a thermistor could be positioned near or under the phosphor material to determine if there was a sudden increase in temperature which may be a result of increased direct irradiation from the blue laser diode indicating a compromised or removed phosphor. Again, in this case the thermistor signal would trip the feedback loop to cease electrical power to the laser diode and shut it off. Of course, these are merely example embodiments, there are several configurations for photodiodes and/or thermistors to be integrated with a laser based white light source to form a safety feature such as a feedback loop to cease operation of the laser.

In many embodiments of the present invention an electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection element is included. For example, an ESD protection element would be used to protect the integrated white light source from damage that could occur with a sudden flow of current resulting from a build-up of charge. In one example a transient voltage suppression (TVS) element is employed.

In all embodiments of the integrated white light source final packaging would need to be considered. There are many aspects of the package that should be accounted for such as form factor, cost, functionality, thermal impedance, sealing characteristics, and basic compatibility with the application. Form factor will depend on the application, but in general making the smallest size packaged white source will be desirable. Cost should be minimized in all applications, but in some applications cost will be the most important consideration. In such cases using an off-the-shelf packages produced in high volume may be desirable. Functionality options include direction and properties of the exiting light emission for the application as well as integration of features such as photodetectors, thermistors, or other electronics or optoelectronics. For best performance and lifetime the thermal impedance of the package should be minimized, especially in high power applications. Examples of sealing configurations include open environment, environmentally sealed, or hermetically sealed. Typically for GaN based lasers it is desirable for hermetically sealed packages, but other packages can be considered and deployed for various applications. Examples of off the shelf packages for the integrated white light source include TO cans such as TO38, TO56, TO9, TO5, or other TO can type packages. Flat packages configured with windows can also be used. Examples of flat packages include a butterfly package like a TOSA. Surface mount device (SMD) packages can also be used, which are attractive due to their low price, hermetic sealing, and potentially low thermal impedance. In other embodiments, custom packages are used. In another embodiment, a “Flash” package could be used for the integrated white light source. For example, this package could be used to adapt the laser based white light source to camera flash applications. One of the standard packaging formats for today's LEDs employ the use of a flat ceramic package, sometimes called “Flash” packages as devices built on these platforms have primarily been used in Camera Flash and Cell Phone applications. The typical flash package consists of a flat ceramic substrate (Alumina or AlN) with attach pads for LED and ESD devices as well as leads providing a location for clipping or soldering external electrical connections to power the device. The phosphor is contained near the LED die via molding or other silicone containing dispensing application. This layer is then typically over molded with a clear silicone lens to improve light extraction. The primary benefits of a package in this format is a very small overall package dimension (˜3 mm×˜5 mm), reasonable light output performance (hundreds of Lumens), small source size and overall low-cost LED device. This package style could also be achieved by employing a laser plus phosphor design style which would potentially could eliminate the encapsulation and lensing steps, providing an LED replacement with superior spot size and brightness. If a protective cover were needed to house the laser and phosphor subcomponents, a hollow glass dome could be used to provide protection.

In some embodiments of this invention, the integrated white light source is combined with optical members to manipulate the generated white light. In an example the white light source could serve in a spot light system such as a flashlight or an automobile headlamp or other light applications where the light must be directed or projected to a specified location or area. In one embodiment a reflector is coupled to the white light source. Specifically, a parabolic (or paraboloid or paraboloidal) reflector is deployed to project the white light. By positioning the white light source in the focus of a parabolic reflector, the plane waves will be reflected and propagate as a collimated beam along the axis of the parabolic reflector. In another example a lens is used to collimate the white light into a projected beam. In one example a simple aspheric lens would be positioned in front of the phosphor to collimate the white light. In another example, a total internal reflector optic is used for collimation. In other embodiments other types of collimating optics may be used such as spherical lenses or aspherical lenses. In several embodiments, a combination of optics is used.

In a specific embodiment of the general invention described above, the present invention is configured for a side-pumped phosphor operated in transmissive mode. In this configuration, the phosphor is positioned in front of the laser facet outputting the laser beam, wherein both the laser and the phosphor are configured on a support member. The gallium and nitrogen containing laser diode is configured with a cavity that has a length greater than 100 μm, greater than 500 μm, greater than 1000 μm, or greater than 1500 μm long and a width greater than 1 μm, greater than 10 μm, greater than 20 μm, greater than 30 μm, or greater than 45 μm. The cavity is configured with a front facets and back facet on the end wherein the front facet comprises the output facet and emits the laser beam incident on the phosphor. The output facet may contain an optical coating to reduce the reflectivity in the cavity. The back facet can be coated with a high reflectivity coating to reduce the amount of light exiting the back of the laser diode. The phosphor is comprised of Ce doped YAG and emits yellow emission. The phosphor is shaped as a block, plate, sphere, cylinder, or other geometrical form. Specifically, the phosphor geometry primary dimensions may be less than 50 μm, less than 100 μm, less than 200 μm, less than 500 μm, less than 1 mm, or less than 10 mm. Operated in transmissive mode, the phosphor has a first primary side for receiving the incident laser beam and at least a second primary side where most of the useful white light will exit the phosphor to be coupled to the application. To improve the efficiency by maximizing the amount of light exiting the second side of the phosphor, the phosphor may be coated with layers configured to modify the reflectivity for certain colors. In one example, a coating configured to increase the reflectivity for yellow light is applied to the first side of the phosphor such that the amount of yellow light emitted from the first side is reduce. In another example, a coating to increase the reflectivity of the blue light is spatially patterned on the first side of the phosphor to allow the excitation light to pass, but prevent backward propagating scattered light to escape. In another example, optical coatings configured to reduce the reflectivity to yellow and blue light are applied to at least the second side of the phosphor to maximize the light escaping from this primary side where the useful light exits. In an alternative embodiment, a powdered phosphor such as a yellow phosphor is dispensed onto a transparent plate or into a solid structure using a binder material and is configured to emit a white light when excited by and combined with the blue laser beam. The powdered phosphors could be comprised of YAG based phosphors, and other phosphors.

With respect to attaching the phosphor to the common support member, thermal impedance is a key consideration. The thermal impedance of this attachment joint should be minimized using the best attaching material, interface geometry, and attachment process practices for the lowest thermal impedance with sufficient reflectivity. Examples include AuSn solders, SAC solders such as SAC305, lead containing solder, or indium, but can be others. In an alternative embodiment sintered Ag pastes or films can be used for the attach process at the interface. Sintered Ag attach material can be dispensed or deposited using standard processing equipment and cycle temperatures with the added benefit of higher thermal conductivity and improved electrical conductivity. For example, AuSn has a thermal conductivity of about 50 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 16 micro-ohm×cm whereas pressureless sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 125 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 4 micro-ohm·cm, or pressured sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 250 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 2.5 micro-ohm×cm. Due to the extreme change in melt temperature from paste to sintered form, (260° C.-900° C.), processes can avoid thermal load restrictions on downstream processes, allowing completed devices to have very good and consistent bonds throughout. The joint could also be formed from thermally conductive glues, thermal epoxies such as silver epoxy, thermal adhesives, and other materials. Alternatively, the joint could be formed from a metal-metal bond such as a Au—Au bond. The common support member with the laser and phosphor material is configured to provide thermal impedance of less than 10 degrees Celsius per watt or less than 5 degrees Celsius per watt of dissipated power characterizing a thermal path from the laser device to a heat sink. The support member is comprised of a thermally conductive material such as copper, copper tungsten, aluminum, alumina, SiC, sapphire, AlN, or other metals, ceramics, or semiconductors. The side-pumped transmissive apparatus has a form factor characterized by a length, a width, and a height. In an example, the height is characterized by a dimension of less than 25 mm, and greater than 0.5 mm, although there may be variations. In an alternative example, the height is characterized by a dimension of less than 12.5 mm, and greater than 0.5 mm, although there may be variations. In yet an alternative example, the length and width are characterized by a dimension of less than 30 mm, less than 15 mm, or less than 5 mm, although there may be variations.

In alternative embodiments of the present invention, multiple phosphors are operated in a transmissive mode for a white emission. In one example, a violet laser diode configured to emit a wavelength of 395 nm to 425 nm and excite a first blue phosphor and a second yellow phosphor. In this configuration, a first blue phosphor plate could be fused or bonded to the second yellow phosphor plate. In a practical configuration the laser beam would be directly incident on the first blue phosphor wherein a fraction of the blue emission would excite the second yellow phosphor to emit yellow emission to combine with blue emission and generate a white light. Additionally, the violet pump would essentially all be absorbed since what may not be absorbed in the blue phosphor would then be absorbed in the yellow phosphor. In an alternative practical configuration, the laser beam would be directly incident on the second yellow phosphor wherein a fraction of the violet electromagnetic emission would be absorbed in the yellow phosphor to excite yellow emission and the remaining violet emission would pass to the blue phosphor and create a blue emission to combine a yellow emission with a blue emission and generate a white light. In an alternative embodiment, a powdered mixture of phosphors would be dispensed onto a transparent plate or into a solid structure using a binder material such that the different color phosphors such as blue and yellow phosphors are co-mingled and are configured to emit a white light when excited by the violet laser beam. The powdered phosphors could be comprised of YAG based phosphors, LuAG phosphors, and other phosphors.

In an alternative embodiment of a multi-phosphor transmissive example according to the present invention, a blue laser diode operating with a wavelength of 425 nm to 480 nm is configured to excite a first green phosphor and a second red phosphor. In this configuration, a first green phosphor plate could be fused or bonded to the second red phosphor plate. In a practical configuration the laser beam would be directly incident on the first green phosphor wherein a fraction of the green emission would excite the second red phosphor to emit red emission to combine with green phosphor emission and blue laser diode emission to generate a white light. In an alternative practical configuration the laser beam would be directly incident on the second red phosphor wherein a fraction of the blue electromagnetic emission would be absorbed in the red phosphor to excite red emission and a portion of the remaining blue laser emission would pass to the green phosphor and create a green emission to combine with the red phosphor emission and blue laser diode emission to generate a white light. In an alternative embodiment, a powdered mixture of phosphors would be dispensed onto a transparent plate or into a solid structure using a binder material such that the different color phosphors such as red and green phosphors are co-mingled and are configured to emit a white light when excited by and combined with the blue laser beam. The powdered phosphors could be comprised of YAG based phosphors, LuAG phosphors, and other phosphors. The benefit or feature of this embodiment is the higher color quality that could be achieved from a white light comprised of red, green, and blue emission. Of course, there could be other variants of this invention including integrating more than two phosphor and could include one of or a combination of a red, green, blue, and yellow phosphor.

In several embodiments according to the present invention, the laser based integrated white light sources is configured as a high CRI white light source with a CRI over 70, over 80, or over 90. In these embodiments, multiple phosphors are used in the form of a mixed power phosphor composition or multiple phosphor plate configuration or others. Examples of such phosphors include, but are not limited to YAG, LuAG, red nitrides, aluminates, oxynitrides, CaMgSi2O6:Eu2+, BAM:Eu2+, AlN:Eu2+, (Sr,Ca)3MgSi2O8:Eu2+, and JEM.

In some configurations of the high CRI embodiments of the integrated laser based white light source a blue laser diode excitation source operating in the wavelength range of 430 nm to 470 nm is used to excite;1) Yellow phosphor+red phosphor, or2) Green phosphor+red phosphor, or3) Cyan phosphor+orange phosphor, or4) Cyan phosphor+orange phosphor+red phosphor, or5) Cyan phosphor+yellow phosphor+red phosphor, or6) Cyan phosphor+green phosphor+red phosphor

In some alternative configurations of the high CRI embodiments of the integrated laser based white light source a violet laser diode excitation source operating in the wavelength range of 390 nm to 430 nm is used to excite;1) Blue phosphor+yellow phosphor+red phosphor, or2) Blue phosphor+green phosphor+red phosphor, or3) Blue phosphor+cyan phosphor+orange phosphor, or4) Blue phosphor+cyan phosphor+orange phosphor+red phosphor, or5) Blue phosphor+cyan phosphor+yellow phosphor+red phosphor, or6) Blue phosphor+cyan phosphor+green phosphor+red phosphor

In an alternative embodiment of a multi-phosphor transmissive example according to the present invention, a blue laser diode operating with a wavelength of 395 nm to 425 nm is configured to excite a first blue phosphor, a second green phosphor, and a third red phosphor. In this one embodiment of this configuration, a first blue phosphor plate could be fused or bonded to the second green phosphor plate which is fused or bonded to the third red phosphor plate. In a practical configuration the laser beam would be directly incident on the first blue phosphor wherein a fraction of the blue emission would excite the second green phosphor and third red phosphor to emit green and red emission to combine with first phosphor blue emission to generate a white light. In an alternative practical configuration the violet laser beam would be directly incident on the third red phosphor wherein a fraction of the violet electromagnetic emission would be absorbed in the red phosphor to excite red emission and a portion of the remaining violet laser emission would pass to the second green phosphor and create a green emission to combine with the red phosphor emission and a portion of the violet laser diode would pass to the first blue phosphor to create a blue emission to combine the red and green emission to generate a white light. In an alternative embodiment, a powdered mixture of phosphors would be dispensed onto a transparent plate or into a solid structure using a binder material such that the different color phosphors such as red, green, and blue phosphors are co-mingled and are configured to emit a white light when excited by the violet laser beam. The powdered phosphors could be comprised of YAG based phosphors, LuAG phosphors, and other phosphors. The benefit or feature of this embodiment is the higher color quality and color rendering quality that could be achieved from a white light comprised of red, green, and blue emission. Of course there could be other variants of this invention including integrating more than two phosphor and could include one of or a combination of a red, green, blue, and yellow phosphor.

In yet another variation of a side pumped phosphor configuration, a “point source” or “point source like” integrated white emitting device is achieved. In this configuration the phosphor would most likely have a cube geometry or spherical geometry such that white light can be emitted from more than 1 primary emission surface. For example, in a cube geometry up to all six faces of the cube can emit white light or in a sphere configuration the entire surface can emit to create a perfect point source. A first strong advantage to this configuration is that the white light spot size is controlled by the phosphor size, which can enable smaller spot sizes than alternative transmissive or reflective mode configurations by avoiding the spot size growth that happens within the phosphor due to scattering, reflection, and lack of efficient absorption in the phosphor. Ultra-small spot sizes are ideal for most efficient collimation in directional applications. A second advantage to this configuration is the ideal heat sinking configuration wherein for the phosphor member it is identical to a reflection mode configuration with the entire bottom surface of the phosphor can be thermally and mechanically attached to a heat-sink. Further, since the laser diode member does not require thick or angled intermediate support members to elevate the beam and dictate an angled incidence as in the reflection mode configurations, the laser can be mounted closer to the base member for a shorter thermal conduction path to the heat-sink. A third advantage is the inherent design for safety since the primary emission may be from the top surface of the phosphor orthogonal to the laser beam direction such that in the event of a phosphor breakage or compromise the laser beam would not be pointing the direction of white light capture. In this configuration, if the phosphor were to be removed or compromised the laser beam would be incident on the side of the package. Moreover, this configuration would avoid the potential issue in a reflective configuration where an escaped beam can result from a reflection of the incident beam on the top of the surface. In this side pumped configuration, the reflected beam would be substantially contained in the package. A fourth advantage is that since the laser diode or SLED device can be mounted flat on the base member, the assembly process and components can be simplified. In this side pumped configuration, it may be advantageous to promote primary emission from the top surface of the phosphor. This could be achieved with treatments to promote light escape from the top surface such as application of an anti-reflective coating or roughening, and treatments to reduce light escape from the side and bottom surfaces such as application of highly reflective layers such as metal or dielectric layers.

In some configurations of this embodiment the phosphor is attached to the common support member wherein the common support member may not be fully transparent. In this configuration the surface or side of the phosphor where it is attached would have impeded light emission and hence would reduce the overall efficiency or quality of the point source white light emitter. However, this emission impediment can be minimized or mitigated to provide a very efficient illumination. In other configurations, the phosphor is supported by a optically transparent member such that the light is free to emit in all directions from the phosphor point source. In one variation, the phosphor is fully surrounded in or encapsulated by an optically transparent material such as a solid material like SiC, diamond, GaN, or other, or a liquid material like water or a more thermally conductive liquid.

In another variation, the support member could also serve as a waveguide for the laser light to reach the phosphor. In another variation, the support member could also serve as a protective safety measure to ensure that no direct emitting laser light is exposed as it travels to reach the phosphor. Such point sources of light that produce true omni-directional emission are increasing useful as the point source becomes increasing smaller, due to the fact that product of the emission aperture and the emission angle is conserved or lost as subsequent optics and reflectors are added. Specifically, for example, a small point source can be collimated with small optics or reflectors. However, if the same small optics and/or reflector assembly are applied to a large point source, the optical control and collimation is diminished.

In some embodiments according to the present invention a periodic 2D photonic crystal structure can be applied to the single crystal or poly crystal phosphor materials structure. The photonic crystal structure would be employed to suppress emission in given directions and re-direct light out of the photonic crystal in a direction suitable and chosen for the device design. Phosphor structures today are largely Lambertian emitters except where waveguiding and critical angle comes into play. Many phosphors today satisfy the basic materials requirements needed to create photonic crystal structures—(dielectric or metallo-dielectric materials with low optical absorption). Adding photonic crystal structures to phosphor plate materials would allow light extraction to be enhanced in 1 direction over another in these materials. This can separate the excitation and emission characteristics thereby allowing greater flexibility in design.

In yet another variation of a side pumped phosphor embodiment, a phosphor is excited from the side and configured to emit a substantial portion of the white light from a top surface. In this configuration the phosphor would most likely have a cubic geometry, a cylindrical geometry, a faceted geometry, a hexagonal geometry, a triangular geometry, a pyramidal geometry, or other multi-sided geometries wherein the white light is configured to be emitted primarily from the top surface of the phosphor. In this configuration the laser beam would enter the phosphor from a first of side of the phosphor where a fraction of the laser excitation light with a first wavelength would be converted to a second wavelength. This first side of the phosphor may be configured for a modified reflectivity such as a coating or treatment to reduce the reflectivity in the blue or violet wavelength range and/or for increased reflectivity for the phosphor emission wavelength range such as yellow. In one example of the side pumped embodiment the laser excitation beam is incident on the first side of the phosphor at the Brewster angle. In further examples, the additional sides of the phosphor may be coated, treated, or shaped for an increased reflectivity to both the laser excitation wavelength and the phosphor conversion wavelength such that the light within the phosphor would be reflected inside the phosphor until it escaped from the top. Special phosphor shaping or coating techniques could be used to enhance the fraction of light escaping the top surface. A first strong advantage to this configuration is that the white light spot size is controlled by the phosphor size, which can enable smaller spot sizes than alternative transmissive or reflective mode configurations by avoiding the spot size growth that happens within the phosphor due to scattering, reflection, and lack of efficient absorption in the phosphor. Ultra-small spot sizes are ideal for most efficient collimation in directional applications. A second advantage to this configuration is the ideal heat sinking configuration wherein for the phosphor member it is identical to a reflection mode configuration with the entire bottom surface of the phosphor can be thermally and mechanically attached to a heat-sink. Further, since the laser diode member does not require thick or angled intermediate support members to elevate the beam and dictate an angled incidence as in the reflection mode configurations, the laser can be mounted closer to the base member for a shorter thermal conduction path to the heat-sink. A third advantage is the inherent design for safety since the primary emission may be from the top surface of the phosphor orthogonal to the laser beam direction such that in the event of a phosphor breakage or compromise the laser beam would not be pointing the direction of white light capture. In this configuration, if the phosphor were to be removed or compromised the laser beam would be incident on the side of the package. Moreover, this configuration would avoid the potential issue in a reflective configuration where an escaped beam can result from a reflection of the incident beam on the top of the surface. In this side pumped configuration, the reflected beam would be substantially contained in the package. A fourth advantage is that since the laser diode or SLED device can be mounted flat on the base member, the assembly process and components can be simplified. In this side pumped configuration, it may be advantageous to promote primary emission from the top surface of the phosphor.

In all of the side pumped and transmissive embodiments of this invention the additional features and designs can be included. For example, shaping of the excitation laser beam for optimizing the beam spot characteristics on the phosphor can be achieved by careful design considerations of the laser beam incident angle to the phosphor or with using integrated optics such as free space optics like collimating lens. In some embodiments re-imaging optics such as re-imaging reflectors are used to shape the excitation beam and/or re-capture excitation light reflected from the phosphor. Safety features can be included such as passive features like physical design considerations and beam dumps and/or active features such as thermal fuses, photodetectors, or thermistors that can be used in a closed loop to turn the laser off when a signal is indicated.

A point source omni-directional light source is configurable into several types of illumination patterns including 4-pi steradian illumination to provide a wide illumination to a three-dimensional volume such as a room, lecture hall, or stadium. Moreover, optical elements can be included to manipulate the generated white light to produce highly directional illumination. In some embodiments, reflectors such as parabolic reflectors or lenses such as collimating lenses are used to collimate the white light or create a spot light that could be applicable in an automobile headlight, flashlight, spotlight, or other lights. In other embodiments, the point source illumination can be modified with cylindrical optics and reflectors into linear omni-directional illumination, or linear directional illumination. Additionally, the point source illumination coupled into planar waveguides for planar 2-pi steradian emission, planar 4-pi steradian emission to produce glare-free illumination patterns that emit from a plane.

In a specific preferred embodiment of the integrated white light source, the present invention is configured for a reflective mode phosphor operation. In one example the excitation laser beam enters the phosphor through the same primary surface as the useful white light is emitted from. That is, operated in reflective mode the phosphor could have a first primary surface configured for both receiving the incident excitation laser beam and emitting useful white light. In this configuration, the phosphor is positioned in front of the laser facet outputting the laser beam, wherein both the laser and the phosphor are configured on a support member. The gallium and nitrogen containing laser diode is configured with a cavity that has a length greater than 100 μm, greater than 500 μm, greater than 1000 μm, or greater than 1500 μm long and a width greater than 1 μm, greater than 10 μm, greater than 20 μm, greater than 30 μm, or greater than 45 μm. The cavity is configured with a front facets and back facet on the end wherein the front facet comprises the output facet and emits the laser beam incident on the phosphor. The output facet may contain an optical coating to reduce the reflectivity in the cavity. The back facet can be coated with a high reflectivity coating to reduce the amount of light exiting the back facet of the laser diode. In one example, the phosphor can be comprised of Ce doped YAG and emits yellow emission. The phosphor may be a powdered ceramic phosphor, a ceramic phosphor plate, or could be a single crystal phosphor. The phosphor is preferably shaped as a substantially flat member such as a plate or a sheet with a shape such as a square, rectangle, polygon, circle, or ellipse, and is characterized by a thickness. In a preferred embodiment the length, width, and or diameter dimensions of the large surface area of the phosphor are larger than the thickness of the phosphor. For example, the diameter, length, and/or width dimensions may be 2× greater than the thickness, 5× greater than the thickness, 10× greater than the thickness, or 50× greater than the thickness. Specifically, the phosphor plate may be configured as a circle with a diameter of greater than 50 μm, greater than 100 μm, greater than 200 μm, greater than 500 μm, greater than 1 mm, or greater than 10 mm and a thickness of less than 500 μm, less than 200 μm, less than 100 μm or less than 50 μm.

In one example of the reflective mode CPoS white light source embodiment of this invention optical coatings, material selections are made, or special design considerations are taken to improve the efficiency by maximizing the amount of light exiting the primary surface of the phosphor. In one example, the backside of the phosphor may be coated with reflective layers or have reflective materials positioned on the back surface of the phosphor adjacent to the primary emission surface. The reflective layers, coatings, or materials help to reflect the light that hits the back surface of the phosphor such that the light will bounce and exit through the primary surface where the useful light is captured. In one example, a coating configured to increase the reflectivity for yellow light and blue light and is applied to the phosphor prior to attaching the phosphor to the common support member. In another example, a reflective material is used as a bonding medium that attaches the phosphor to the support member or to an intermediate submount member. Examples of reflective materials include reflective solders and reflective glues, but could be others. In some configurations the top primary surface of the phosphor wherein the laser excitation beam is incident is configured for a reduced reflectivity to the blue or violet excitation beam wavelength and/or the phosphor emission wavelength such as a yellow wavelength. The reduced reflectivity can be achieved with an optical coating of the phosphor using dielectric layers, a shaping of the phosphor surface, and roughening of the phosphor surface, or other techniques. In some examples the laser beam incident angle is configured at or near Brewster's angle, wherein the light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through the primary surface of the phosphor. Due to the divergence of the laser resulting in a variation of incident angles for the plane waves within the beam a perfect transmission may be challenging, but ideally a substantial fraction of the light incident on the phosphor could be at or near Brewster's angle. For example, a YAG or LuAG phosphor may have a refractive index of about 1.8 in the violet and blue wavelength range. With the Brewster angle, θB, given as arctan (n2/n1), where n1 is the index of air and n2 is the index of the phosphor, would be about 61 degrees [or about 55 to 65 degrees], off of the axis of normal incidence. Or alternatively, about 29 degrees [or about 25 to 35 degrees] rotated from the axis parallel to the phosphor surface.

With respect to attaching the phosphor to the common support member, thermal impedance is a key consideration. The thermal impedance of this attachment joint should be minimized using the best attaching material, interface geometry, and attachment process practices for the lowest thermal impedance with sufficient reflectivity. Examples include AuSn solders, such as SAC305, lead containing solder, or indium, but can be others. In an alternative embodiment sintered Ag pastes or films can be used for the attach process at the interface. Sintered Ag attach material can be dispensed or deposited using standard processing equipment and cycle temperatures with the added benefit of higher thermal conductivity and improved electrical conductivity. For example, AuSn has a thermal conductivity of about 50 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 16 micro-ohm×cm whereas pressureless sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 125 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 4 micro-ohm×cm, or pressured sintered Ag can have a thermal conductivity of about 250 W/(m·K) and electrical conductivity of about 2.5 micro-ohm×cm. Due to the extreme change in melt temperature from paste to sintered form, (260° C.-900° C.), processes can avoid thermal load restrictions on downstream processes, allowing completed devices to have very good and consistent bonds throughout. The joint could also be formed from thermally conductive glues, thermal epoxies, and other materials. The common support member with the laser and phosphor material is configured to provide thermal impedance of less than 10 degrees Celsius per watt or less than 5 degrees Celsius per watt of dissipated power characterizing a thermal path from the laser device to a heat sink. The support member is comprised of a thermally conductive material such as copper, copper tungsten, aluminum, SiC, sapphire, AlN, or other metals, ceramics, or semiconductors. The reflective mode white light source apparatus has a form factor characterized by a length, a width, and a height. In an example, the height is characterized by a dimension of less than 25 mm and greater than 0.5 mm, although there may be variations. In an alternative example, the height is characterized by a dimension of less than 12.5 mm, and greater than 0.5 mm, although there may be variations. In yet an alternative example, the length and width are characterized by a dimension of less than 30 mm, less than 15 mm, or less than 5 mm, although there may be variations.

The reflective mode integrated white light source embodiment of this invention is configured with the phosphor member attached to the common support member with the large primary surface configured for receiving laser excitation light and emitting useful white light positioned at an angle normal (about 90 degrees) or off-normal (about 0 degrees to about 89 degrees) to the axis of the laser diode output beam functioning to excite the phosphor. That is, the laser output beam is pointing toward the phosphor's emission surface at an angle of between 0 and 90 degrees. The nature of this configuration wherein the laser beam is not directed in the same direction the primary phosphor emission surface emits is a built-in safety feature. That is, the laser beam is directed away from or opposite of the direction the useful white light will exit the phosphor. As a result, if the phosphor is to break or get damaged during normal operation or from tampering, the laser beam would not be directed to the outside world where it could be harmful. Instead, the laser beam would be incident on the backing surface where the phosphor was attached. As a result, the laser beam could be scattered or absorbed instead of exiting the white light source and into the surrounding environment. Additional safety measure can be taken such as using a beam dump feature or use of an absorbing material such as a thermal fuse that heats up and creates an open circuit within the laser diode drive circuit.

One example of this reflective mode integrated white light source embodiment is configured with the laser beam normal to the primary phosphor emission surface. In this configuration the laser diode would be positioned in front of the primary emission surface of the phosphor where it could impede the useful white light emitted from the phosphor. In a preferable embodiment of this reflective mode integrated white light source, the laser beam would be configured with an incident angle that is off-axis to the phosphor such that it hits the phosphor surface at an angle of between 0 and 89 degrees or at a “grazing” angle. In some configurations the incident angle is configured at or near Brewster's angle to maximize the transmission of the laser excitation light into the phosphor. In this preferable embodiment the laser diode device is positioned to the side of the phosphor instead of in front of the phosphor where it will not substantially block or impede the emitted white light. Moreover, in this configuration the built in safety feature is more optimal than in the normal incidence configuration since when incident at an angle in the case of phosphor damage or removal the incident laser beam would not reflect directly off the back surface of the support member where the phosphor was attached. By hitting the surface at an off-angle or a grazing angle any potential reflected components of the beam can be directed to stay within the apparatus and not exit the outside environment where it can be a hazard to human beings, animals, and the environment.

In all of the reflective mode embodiments of this invention the additional features and designs can be included. For example, shaping of the excitation laser beam for optimizing the beam spot characteristics on the phosphor can be achieved by careful design considerations of the laser beam incident angle to the phosphor or with using integrated optics such as free space optics like collimating lens. Beam shaping can also be achieved by using two or more adjacent parallel emitter stripes spaced by 10 μm to 30 μm, or 30 μm to 50 μm, or 100 μm to 250 μm such that the beam is enlarged in the slow-divergence axis from the laser emission apertures. Beam shaping may also be achieved with re-imaging optics. Safety features can be included such as passive features like physical design considerations and beam dumps and/or active features such as photodetectors or thermistors that can be used in a closed loop or a type of feedback loop to turn the laser off when a signal is indicated. Moreover, optical elements can be included to manipulate the generated white light. In some embodiments, reflectors such as parabolic reflectors or lenses such as collimating lenses are used to collimate the white light or create a spot light that could be applicable in an automobile headlight, flashlight, spotlight, or other lights.

In some embodiments according to the present invention, multiple laser diode sources are configured to excite the same phosphor or phosphor network. Combining multiple laser sources can offer many potential benefits according to this invention. First, the excitation power can be increased by beam combining to provide a more powerful excitation spit and hence produce a brighter light source. In some embodiments, separate individual laser chips are configured within the laser-phosphor light source. By including multiple lasers emitting 1 W, 2 W, 3 W, 4 W, 5 W or more power each, the excitation power can be increased and hence the source brightness would be increased. For example, by including two 3 W lasers exciting the same phosphor area, the excitation power can be increased to 6 W for double the white light brightness. In an example where about 200 lumens of white are generated per 1 watt of laser excitation power, the white light output would be increased from 600 lumens to 1200 lumens. Similarly, the reliability of the source can be increased by using multiple sources at lower drive conditions to achieve the same excitation power as a single source driven at more harsh conditions such as higher current and voltage. A second advantage is the potential for a more circular spot by rotating the first free space diverging elliptical laser beam by 90 degrees relative to the second free space diverging elliptical laser beam and overlapping the centered ellipses on the phosphor. Alternatively, a more circular spot can be achieved by rotating the first free space diverging elliptical laser beam by 180 degrees relative to the second free space diverging elliptical laser beam and off-centered overlapping the ellipses on the phosphor to increase spot diameter in slow axis diverging direction. In another configuration, more than 2 lasers are included and some combination of the above described beam shaping spot geometry shaping is achieved.

For example, two or more blue excitation lasers with slightly detuned wavelengths (e.g. 5 nm 10 nm, 15 nm, etc.) can be included to excite a yellow phosphor and create a larger blue spectrum.

This invention relates generally to the delivery of merchandise, and more particularly, to the delivery of merchandise using autonomous ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles.

BACKGROUND

In the retail setting, one important challenge is the delivery of merchandise to customers. Frequently, customers will order merchandise for delivery to their residence or other delivery location within a certain scheduled time. Various delivery methods are available, including the use of a retailer's delivery vehicles and third party delivery services. Recently, efforts have been made to employ autonomous ground vehicles to complete deliveries to customers.

The use of autonomous ground vehicles, however, presents its own challenges. More specifically, autonomous ground vehicles will often encounter obstacles that may prevent them from completing the delivery, such as, for example, motor vehicles, people, animals, road construction, curbs, and closed gates. If the autonomous ground vehicle is unable to complete a delivery due to an obstacle, it is desirable to have a back-up mechanism available to complete the delivery.

Such abnormality during installation of the valves may lead to improper valve actuations and may subsequently affect performance of the machine. Therefore, during the installation of the valves, it may be necessary to test an assembly between the valves and the ports of the machine.

11877919	"BACKGROUND

Male incontinence is a worldwide problem. It can be the byproduct of a wide variety of health issues, including aging, prostate surgery or sphincterotomy, medications, kidney disease, and others. Incontinence can have a major impact on one's lifestyle. The inability to control urination can affect almost every activity, resulting from fear of consequence or embarrassment.

Nursing homes, with an elderly male population, have a great need for a solution to this problem, which also demands staff attention throughout the day. The impact on active younger men with incontinence may be even greater. Early diagnosis of prostate cancer followed by surgery, for example, can lead to many years or decades of daily lifestyle modifications.

Stopping involuntary urinary flow can be achieved by adequately restricting the urethra, but doing so throughout the day while not causing discomfort or inconvenience has proven to be the challenge. Present art is focused on impeding urinary flow while compromising comfort and convenience. Hard-body mechanisms, including clamps and encirclement devices that wrap around the penis circumference, or otherwise, are unyielding and subject to movement when periodic forces are applied when the user is active. Even normal body movement will place periodic asymmetric pressures on such devices, thereby imparting forces which may cause a displacement and/or discomfort. The present art requires removal, adjustment, or repositioning prior to regular urinations. After urination, the process is reversed. Such demands do not always suit the circumstances when the need for urination arises. Convenience is not a medical term, but to many users it can also be a fundamental requirement in addition to comfort, effective urinary control, and limited impact on blood circulation.

Accordingly, a need exists for a male incontinence control device that is convenient to use and performs well without discomfort or required management throughout the day prior to, during, or after urination.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention is directed to a male incontinence control device and related methods of using the device.

In a first embodiment, the male incontinence control device is a male incontinence control device that includes (a) a single-piece continuous loop of an elastic compression band defining a lumen, the elastic compression band configured and arranged to securely encircle a flaccid penis without inflicting penile ischemia, and (b) an inwardly projecting bump on the elastic compression band configured and arranged for pressing against and constricting the urethra of a wearer.

In a second embodiment, the male incontinence control device is (a) a continuous looped band of material defining a lumen wherein the band has an integrated first elastic length and a second inelastic length, and is configured and arranged to securely encircle a flaccid penis without inflicting penile ischemia, and an inwardly projecting bump on the band configured and arranged for pressing against and restricting the urethra of a wearer.

The lumen of the male incontinence control device preferably has an elliptic cross-section with a major axis centered through a top and bottom portion of the elastic compression band and a minor axis centered through side portions of the elastic compression band, and the volumetric center of the bump is essentially aligned with the minor axis.

The device preferably includes diametrically opposed first and second removal loops extending radially outward from the elastic compression band in alignment with the minor axis of the lumen, with the removal loops configured and arranged to accommodate passage of at least one fingertip through each removal loop to facilitate manual outward radial stretching of the elastic compression band.

The device is operable for controlling male incontinence, by (i) manually radially stretching the continuous elastic compression band so as to enlarge the lumen, (ii) inserting the penis of a male in need of incontinence control through the enlarged lumen with the bump on the device positioned proximate the underside of the penis, and (iii) releasing the band whereby the band contracts around the shaft of the penis, and the bump presses against and restricts the urethra.

A male wearing the device can urinate while wearing the device by consciously initiating voiding of his bladder without adjusting or removing the device, whereby (i) the bladder contracts, (ii) the bladder outlet relaxes, and (iii) the flow of urine within the urethra exerts a pressure sufficient to overcome the pressure exerted upon the urethra by the bump on the device so as to permit micturition.

The device, when equipped with removal loops, can be removed from operable engagement with a penis by (i) inserting at least one finger tip from a first hand into the first removal loop, and inserting at least one finger tip from a second hand into the second removal loop, (ii) manually stretching the elastic compression band so as to enlarge the lumen by pulling the loops away from one another, and (iii) sliding the manually stretched elastic compression band off the penis.

The device, when equipped with removal loops, can also be removed from operable engagement with a penis by (i) inserting at least a first and a second finger tip from a first hand into the first removal loop, and inserting at least a first and a second finger tip from a second hand into the second removal loop, (ii) manually radially stretching the elastic compression band so as to enlarge the lumen by both pulling the loops away from one another and expanding the first and second finger tips in each removal loop away from one another, and (iii) sliding the manually stretched elastic compression band off the penis.

This application is a 35 U.S.C. § 371 national phase application of PCT/NL2020/050418 (WO 2020/263093), filed on Jun. 25, 2020, entitled “PREFORMING SYSTEM AND METHOD”, which application claims the benefit of Netherlands Application No. 2023372, filed Jun. 25, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention generally relates to a preforming system comprising a placement robot with a ply manipulating part for automated sequential laying of plies at a desired location with a preselected attitude to preform a composite structure. The invention also generally relates to a method for automated sequential laying of plies at a desired location with a preselected attitude to preform a composite structure.

During the fabrication of composite or so-called laminate structures, generally a group of plies may be sequentially laid up at desired locations on a substrate in order to strengthen, stiffen and/or otherwise provide a structure with required structural and/or performance characteristics. The substrate may include a flat planar surface, a mold, a mandrel or another preforming tool on which the layup process is performed. Often, a layup process may be performed by hand. For example, using hand layup techniques, a technician places each ply individually on the substrate at a precise location and orientation relative to the substrate and/or other plies. The orientation of the ply relative to a fixed reference frame of the substrate is also known as the attitude. Usually, the hand layup process requires plies to be placed one at a time, and ply size may be limited to what the technician can handle manually. The hand layup techniques are time consuming, labor intensive and costly. Also, hand layup techniques may be less suitable for large scale fabrication and/or mass production.

Generally, automated tape laying or automated fiber placement techniques may be used for the fabrication of relatively complex and/or large scale laminate structures. With these techniques fiber reinforcements are placed on or in molds or mandrels in an automatic fashion and are laid up in a number of separate, relatively narrow strips or tows of thermoset or thermoplastic pre-impregnated materials. However, these techniques are not well suited for all applications. Besides, certain ply materials may be relatively delicate and/or susceptible to wrinkling, creasing and/or tearing when processed with these techniques.

An automated system to sequentially layup plies at particular locations on or in the mold or mandrel has previously been proposed so as to free up automated tape laying equipment from laying many relatively small plies in localized areas. For example, in U.S. Patent Publication Number 2012/0330453 A1 an automated ply layup system is shown for filling localized gaps between stringers and frames of an airframe and/or for filling localized pockets in a (curved) mandrel of e.g. (part of) an aircraft fuselage. Thereto, an operator places a tray with a group of plies arranged in a set or so-called kit of plies at a work cell and initiates an automated ply layup cycle. The automated ply layup system then optically recognizes and selects a next ply in the sequence from the kit of plies. Thereafter, the automated ply layup system controls a placement robot with a ply manipulating part to lift the next-in-sequence ply from the kit and to place the ply at a placement location on or in the mold or mandrel based on detected location features at the placement location.

A disadvantage of this system is that the tray of plies is placed by an operator such that there is room for human error. Also, the system may be less suitable for mass production. Further, a drawback is that the system is unfamiliar with the contents of the tray with the kit of plies that is supplied from an external source. Furthermore, the next-in-sequence ply needs to be optically recognized by the placement robot which may slow down the fabrication and may require a costly vision system with relatively complex image recognition and/or processing capability. Also, the placement robot requires a detector, such as a 3-D laser scanner, for detecting locational features at the placement location to place the ply on or in the mold or mandrel.

The invention aims to mitigate at least some of the above mentioned drawbacks. In particular, the invention aims to provide a simplified preforming system for automated sequential laying of plies with which the manufacturing efficiency may be improved. In particular, to provide a cost-effective system with an improved throughput for mass production of composite structures.

Thereto, the invention provides a preforming system for automated sequential laying of plies, in particular fiber reinforced plies, at a desired location with a preselected attitude to preform a composite structure, comprising at least one buffer provided with two or more carriers, a controller, a placement robot provided with a ply manipulating part, and a substrate, wherein each carrier is arranged to carry at least one presorted ply, wherein the controller keeps track of a position, type and sequential order of the at least one presorted ply per carrier, and wherein the controller further controls the placement robot to manipulate and transport at least one ply by means of the ply manipulating part from a selected carrier of the two or more carriers to the substrate and to place the at least one ply at the desired location with the preselected attitude.

By providing a buffer comprising two or more carriers each arranged to carry at least one presorted ply, a convenient arrangement for buffering presorted plies may be obtained. Elegantly, each carriers may be embodied as, or may include shelves or trays. By providing a controller that keeps track of a position, type and sequential order of the at least one presorted ply per carrier, the system is familiar with an assortment of next-in-sequence plies and may anticipate accordingly for efficient throughput of plies.

By providing a placement robot with a ply manipulating part, the system may reduce or prevent ply wrinkling, creasing and/or tearing and may provide more control over the sequential laying of plies. When the controller controls the placement robot to manipulate and transport the at least one ply by means of the ply manipulating part from a selected carrier of the two or more carriers to the substrate and to place the at least one ply at the desired location with the preselected attitude, the automated sequential laying of plies to preform a composite structure may be simplified, e.g. without requiring optical recognition of next-in-sequence plies. In addition, no detector, such as a 3-D laser scanner, is required for detecting locational features at the placement location to adjust the placement of the ply. Thereby, the manufacturing efficiency may be improved, in particular cost-effectively.

By providing an assessment device configured to assess a position and orientation of the at least one ply relative to the ply manipulating part of the placement robot when manipulating the at least one ply from the selected carrier, the assessed position and orientation of the at least one ply may e.g. be translated into a 3-D spatial coordinate system of the placement robot by applying offsets to the assessed position and orientation or using other techniques. When the assessment device is coupled to the controller, and wherein the controller controls the placement robot at least partly based on the assessed position and orientation to place the at least one ply at the desired location with the preselected attitude, a relatively accurate placement may be obtained.

When the assessment device is a stationary optical device, wherein the controller controls the placement robot to present the at least one ply to the stationary optical device for assessing the position and orientation of the at least one preselected ply relative to the ply manipulating part of the placement robot, the position and orientation may be assessed reliably and/or reproducibly while facilitating a relatively unobstructed view of the at least one ply by the stationary optical device. In particular, an outer surface of the at least one ply may be presented in a substantially planar orientation to facilitate the assessment.

When the controller controls the placement robot based only on the assessed position and orientation of the at least one ply relative to the ply manipulating part of the placement robot to align the at least one ply for placement at the desired location with the preselected attitude, the at least one ply that is next-in-sequence may conveniently be brought into a proper alignment for relatively accurate placement. That is to say, without requiring optical recognition to select the correct next-in-sequence ply and/or without requiring detection of locational features for adjusting placement. Therefore, by properly aligning the at least one ply for placement based on the assessed position and orientation, blind transport and placement may be facilitated. In particular, placement may remain unhindered en route to the substrate and during placement, while placement at the desired location with the preselected attitude is ensured.

When the carriers are movable relative to the at least one buffer and to each other, a flexible configuration may be obtained. When the controller controls the movement of the carriers and/or the at least one buffer such that, during use, the at least one ply is made available to at least the ply manipulating part of the placement robot for manipulation and transport of the at least one ply from the selected carrier, the at least one ply that is next-in-sequence may conveniently be made available to the ply manipulation part of the placement robot. This way, the placement robot may at least partially be freed up for placement of the at least one ply, improving the preforming throughput. In particular, the selected carrier may be made available at a predetermined delivery point to further facilitate the placement robot and save handling time.

Advantageously, each carrier may comprise a substantially planar support face. This way, plies including for example pliable sheet-like or planar materials, may be supported in a substantially planar orientation, which reduces the chance of damage. Also, by arranging each carrier to comprise a substantially planar support face, the carrier may be standardized to support plies of different manufacture, such as plies cut from a sheet, plies sectioned from a web of tape, and ply parts or components from e.g. automated tape laying equipment to be assembled into a composite structure.

When the system comprises at least one sorting robot provided with a handling part for handling and transporting at least one ply, wherein the controller or a further controller controls the at least one sorting robot to selectively load each carrier of the at least one buffer with at least one ply, each carrier of the at least one buffer may conveniently be loaded selectively using the sorting robot. Thereby, each carrier may be loaded with a presorted ply of a certain type having a known position and sequential order. Also, a particularly convenient system may be obtained, by combining the sorting robot for selectively loading each carrier with the movable carriers described herein above. This way, each carrier may be moved to a loading position that allows selective loading of at least one ply and a make available position that allows manipulation of the at least one ply for placement. Optionally, each carrier may be moved to a buffering position in which the carriers have a covering arrangement that prevents selective loading and manipulation of the at least one ply. Such covering arrangement saves space, counteracts faulty sequential layup and/or prevents contamination due to sheltering.

When the preforming system is arranged such that during use the sorting robot and the placement robot can access a same buffer of the at least one buffer without relocating the placement robot, the sorting robot and the buffer with respect to each other, a particularly compact and versatile system can be provided, in particular with a relatively small footprint. To that end the buffer and the robots may be dimensioned and/or located such that a same buffer is within reach for both robots, for example at the same time and/or interchangeably, in particular with relatively little delay. It will be appreciated that said robots and buffer may still be relocatable with respect to each other.

Whereas traditionally ply sorting precedes ply placement and preforming in a substantially one-way flow, such a configuration enables more freedom in terms of sequentially ordering sorting, placement and preforming activities in a preforming system.

Advantageously, placement and sorting activities can thus be executed in various sequential orders as needed, with particularly low robotic idle time. The buffer or buffers can thus be used particularly efficiently, wherein for example a robot can place intermediate products such as half-finished preforms in the same buffer that is used for holding plies, e.g. back in the same buffer that plies for the preform were taken out of. In this sense, a material flow can thus be reversed.

The sorting robot and/or the placement robot are optionally configured to take one or more carriers out of the buffer, and/or to place one or more carriers into the buffer, for example each from a different side of the buffer and/or each from a same side of the buffer. During said taking out and/or placing a carrier of the one or more carriers for example holds one or more items such as one or more plies and/or one or more intermediate products such as preforms, in particular such that the one or more items are thereby exchanged between two or more of the sorting robot, the placement robot and the buffer.

The sorting robot and the placement robot are optionally at least partially integrated with each other, in particular such that both robots can access the same buffer. Said buffer can be integrated with the integrated robots. The sorting robot and the placement robot can be at least partially integrated by for example sharing a common robot arm which is configured for both placement and sorting, e.g. selectively configured for placement or for sorting. Preferably such an integrated robot is configured to automatically switch between a sorting mode and a placement mode. Alternatively or additionally such robots can be at least partially integrated by sharing a controller, a motor and/or a housing.

When the buffer is configured to be accessed by multiple robots, or by a robot and an operator, at the same time, items such as plies and intermediate products can advantageously be exchanged relatively freely between robots and/or between a robot and an operator. Preferably the buffer is to that end accessible from at least two sides, e.g. two opposite sides, of the buffer.

An additional robot, for example a sorting robot and/or a placement robot, can thus be deployed at the same buffer if and when needed to increase processing capacity in a particularly dynamic and versatile manner. Alternatively or additionally an operator can thus advantageously place, replace and/or remove items from the buffer, e.g. manually, without disturbing a robot which is active at the same buffer.

When each carrier is releasably mounted to the at least one buffer, each carrier may be removed from the at least one buffer for selective loading of the at least one ply and/or manipulation of the at least one ply for placement. In other words, each carrier may transit through the at least one buffer, e.g. to be placed conveniently for selective loading by the at least one sorting robot and/or to be placed near the substrate for further reducing handling time of the placement robot. In addition, when at least two buffers are provided, the releasably mounted carriers may be transferred between buffers. Elegantly, the shelves or trays may be removable from each carrier. Each carrier, shelf and/or tray may be removable from the at least one buffer. This way, at least one ply may be loaded to or offloaded from the at least one buffer with a carrier, shelf or tray.

By further arranging the handling part of the at least one sorting robot to handle carriers, such that the carriers are transferrable between buffers by means of the sorting robot, the at least one sorting robot may conveniently transfer, i.e. transport and (un)mount, carriers carrying at least one presorted ply to and/or transfer e.g. empty carriers from the at least one buffer. Thereby, (empty) carriers may be selectively loaded with at least one ply by the at least one sorting robot remote from the buffer and/or carriers with at least one presorted ply may be transferred to the at least one buffer further reducing handling time and increasing manufacturing efficiency.

By providing a transportation track and a plurality of buffers disposed along the transportation track, wherein the transportation track comprises a manipulator for manipulating and transporting at least one ply along the transportation track between the plurality of buffers, plies may conveniently be transported between the buffers. The manipulator may e.g. be or comprise a moving belt surface or driven rollers arranged to transport plies in a substantially planar orientation, or may comprise product holders arranged to hold at least one ply and that are arranged to be moved individually along the transportation track to visit buffers. Additionally or alternatively, the manipulator may be arranged to transport carriers or shelves between the buffers. In particular, the manipulator may be or may comprise the at least one sorting robot, such that the at least one sorting robot is transportable along the transportation track between the plurality of buffers. Thereto, the transportation track may e.g. be a guide comprising a sliding rail for slidingly transporting the at least one sorting robot along the transportation track and/or a gantry system.

By providing at least one ply feed, such as a feed associated with the output of a sheet cutter, a tape sectioner or an automated tape-laying device, a production line may be achieved in an elegant way. This way, at least one ply from at least one ply feed may conveniently be kept track of for automated sequential laying of plies, e.g. from feed to preform. Thereby, the manufacturing efficiency may be further improved, especially a cost-effective system with an improved throughput for mass production of composite structures.

Advantageously, the at least one sorting robot may be arranged to transport at least one ply from the at least one ply feed and to the at least one buffer to selectively load each carrier of the at least one buffer.

In an elegant way, the at least one buffer and the at least one ply feed may be disposed along a transportation track comprising a manipulator for manipulating and transporting at least one ply along the transportation track between the at least one ply feed and the at least one buffer, similar as described hereinabove for the system comprising a plurality of buffers. In particular, the manipulator may be or may comprise the at least one sorting robot, such that the at least one sorting robot is transportable along the transportation track between the at least one ply feed and the at least one buffer. Preferably, the at least one ply feed and the plurality of buffers are disposed along the transportation track.

By providing each ply feed with a dedicated feed buffer, plies from the at least one ply feed may conveniently be buffered as the positioning and sequential ordering of plies on one of the carriers generally outpaces the placement of plies at the desired location with a preselected attitude on the substrate. That is to say, plies are fed to the preforming system faster than a composite structure can be preformed, because of the higher degree of accuracy that is required for placement versus positioning and sequential ordering of plies for layup, especially if plies from more than one feed are required for preforming said composite structure. By providing at least one supply robot for handling and transporting at least one ply, wherein the controller or a further controller controls the at least one supply robot to selectively load each carrier of the dedicated feed buffer with at least one ply, the throughput may be further improved by automated positioning and sequential sorting of plies from each ply feed in its dedicated feed buffer and freeing up each ply feed to obtain higher ply production rates while providing buffering for the preforming of composite structures. This may be particularly advantageous for mass production of composite structures.

The invention further provides for a method for automated sequential laying of plies, in particular fiber reinforced plies, at a desired location with a preselected attitude to preform a composite structure, comprising the steps of providing a buffer with at least two carriers, providing each carrier with at least one ply of the same type, such that the carriers in-a-whole carry at least two types of plies, keeping track of a position, type and sequential order of each at least one ply on each carrier of the buffer, selecting a carrier from the at least two carriers to make the selected carrier with at least one ply available to a ply manipulating part of a placement robot, manipulating the at least one ply from the selected carrier by means of the ply manipulating part of the placement robot, transporting the at least one ply by means of the placement robot to a substrate, placing the transported at least one ply by means of the ply manipulating part at a desired location with a preselected attitude on the substrate.

For aligning the manipulated at least one ply for placement at the desired location with the preselected attitude a position and an orientation of the manipulated at least one ply relative to the ply manipulating part may be assessed. Preferably, the alignment is based only on the assessed position and orientation of the manipulated at least one ply relative to the ply manipulating part of the placement robot as discussed above. This allows more efficient and cost-effective manufacturing. To facilitate assessing the position and orientation of the manipulated at least one ply relative to the ply manipulating part, an image of the ply on the ply manipulating part may be recorded.

By feeding at least one ply from a ply feed, in particular a ply feed associated with an output of e.g. a sheet cutter, a tape sectioner or an automated tape-laying device, and keeping track the position, type, and sequential order of the at least one ply fed from the ply feed, a particularly efficient process for fabricating composite preforms may be obtained that requires relatively little feedback, such as detection and inspection steps.

Typically plies may be pliable sheet-like or planar materials that are to be laid up sequentially for fabrication of composite or laminated structures. A variety of plies may be manipulated, i.e. lifted, oriented and/or placed, by the ply manipulating part, such as thermoplastics, prepregs, thermosets, metal foils, backing material and adhesive layers. Within the context of this application, the term “ply” should be construed to include a wide variety of shapes and reinforced plastics. Often, reinforced plastics may comprise fiber reinforced material with a dispersed reinforcement phase embedded in a continuous matrix phase having a fine interphase region. In general, the reinforcement is in the form of (dis)continuous fibers, such as carbon fibers or aramid fibers, embedded in a matrix material, such as thermosetting resin or thermoplastic plastics material. In addition, the plies may comprise a backing material. Such plies are generally known and are used for manufacturing laminated or composite products.

1. Field

Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to power distribution. More specifically, embodiments relate to power distribution, current monitoring, and control systems for vehicles and battery-powered devices.

2. Related Art

Utility vehicles typically include auxiliary devices that are powered by a battery on the utility vehicle. For example, the auxiliary devices may include a front bumper winch, a DC hydraulic pump, and an inverter. To power the auxiliary devices, cables are used to connect the battery to the auxiliary device such that current can flow to the device. Fuses and solenoids are typically used to ensure safe operations of the auxiliary devices. However, due to the relatively large size of the solenoids, the solenoids are unable to be located at or in proximity to the battery. Thus, a cable must be run from the battery to the auxiliary device to accommodate the size of the solenoid. The cables are wired battery hot due to the high current from the battery and take up space in the utility vehicle. Furthermore, the cables are only protected by a fuse and, as such, lower current shorts are not detectable.

BACKGROUND

In healthy individuals, acquired dietary methionine is catabolized via the trans-sulfuration pathway, where mammalian cells catabolize methionine into homocysteine via S-Adenosyl-methionine and S-Adenosyl-homocysteine. The cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) enzyme then catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine using vitamin B6(pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, PLP) as a co-enzyme. Another PLP-dependent enzyme, cystathionine γ-lyase, converts cystathionine into cysteine. Genetic mutations in one or more of these genes can cause metabolic perturbation in the trans-sulfuration pathway that leads to homocystinuria, also known as cystathionine beta synthase deficiency (“CBS deficiency”) (Garland et al.,J. Ped. Child Health,4(8):557-562, 1999). In homocystinuria patients, CBS enzyme deficiency causes elevated levels of homocysteine and low levels of cystathionine in the serum, which leads to excretion of homocysteine into the urine. Inherited homocystinuria, a serious life-threatening disease, results in high levels of homocysteine in plasma, tissues and urine. Some of the characteristics of the most common form of homocystinuria are myopia (nearsightedness), lens dislocation, higher risk of thromboembolism, and skeletal abnormalities. Homocystinuria may also cause developmental delay/intellectual disability (Mudd et al.,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,37:1-31, 1985).

A subpopulation of patients with homocystinuria can be treated with vitamin B6to increase the residual activity of the CBS enzyme. The B6non-responsive patients have to drastically limit the intake of dietary methionine to lower the levels of serum homocysteine. Compliance with a life-long low protein diet combined with methionine-free formula, is often poor, especially among the adults (Gupta et al.,J. Inherit Metab. Dis.,2016, 39(1):3946; Mudd et al.,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,37:1-31, 1985; Orgeron et al.,Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci.,2014, 121:351-376). Hence, other options for treating homocystinuria are needed.

11991567	"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to a technology for controlling the state of a wireless communication apparatus.

Description of the Related Art

Cellular communication standards of the Fifth Generation (5G) are being established in the 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project). So far, a Dual Connectivity (DC) function that enables a terminal equipment (User Equipment, UE) to be connected to a plurality of base stations and concurrently communicate with the plurality of base stations has been standardized in the cellular communication standards. If a UE concurrently communicates with a plurality of base stations based on the DC, user throughput and communication reliability can be improved. The DC enables a UE to concurrently communicate with a base station that functions as a Master Node (MN) that manages Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection and context of the UE and a base station that functions as a Secondary Node (SN) that does not perform such management.

Regarding the state of the UE, an RRC_Inactive state is defined in 5G, in addition to an RRC_Idle state, which is a conventional unconnected state, and an RRC_Connected state, which is a connected state. In the RRC_Inactive state, the UE is in an unconnected state in a lower layer but is in a connected state in an upper layer with a base station. Transmission of control signals to the UE in the RRC_Inactive state is suppressed, and accordingly power consumption of the UE can be suppressed, and the UE can immediately establish a network connection when resuming communication because the UE is in the connected state in the upper layer.

3GPP TS 37.340 V15.4.0 describes processing that is performed when a UE that has been performing communication using the DC transitions to the RRC_Inactive state, and also describes that the UE can resume the RRC_Connected state if radio resources of the MN and the SN before the transition can be used. On the other hand, specific processing for resuming the RRC_Connected state as described above is not defined.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a technology for efficiently resuming connection of a terminal equipment.

According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a communication apparatus capable of executing concurrent communication with a first base station and a second base station based on Dual Connectivity (DC) defined in cellular communication standards of the Third Generation Partnership Project, the first base station operating as a master node in the DC and the second base station operating as a secondary node in the DC, the communication apparatus comprising: one or more processors; and one or more memories that store a computer-readable instruction that causes, when executed by the one or more processors, the communication apparatus to control the state of the communication apparatus such that, if the state of the communication apparatus has transitioned from an RRC_Inactive state to an RRC_Connected state in a state in which settings related to the DC are maintained, the RRC_Connected state is maintained regardless of whether or not connection processing for establishing a connection to the second base station is successful.

Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).

This specification relates to identifying microorganisms using three-dimensional (3D) quantitative phase imaging. This specification incorporates by reference in its entirety U.S. Ser. No. 62/817,680, entitled “Rapid identification of biological entities,” and filed on Mar. 13, 2019.

BACKGROUND

The term microorganism can refer to, e.g., bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The type of a microorganism may refer to, e.g., the genus, species, strain, metabolism, morphology, motility, or any other appropriate characteristic of the microorganism.

Quantitative phase imaging characterizes a specimen by quantifying phase shifts induced in light passing through the specimen.

SUMMARY

This specification describes a method and apparatus for identifying a microorganism by processing a 3D quantitative phase image (QPI) of the microorganism using a neural network, e.g., a 3D convolutional neural network.

According to a first aspect there is provided a method for identifying the predicted type of one or more microorganisms. The method includes using a phase-contrast microscope to generate a three-dimensional quantitative phase image of one or more microorganisms, where the three-dimensional quantitative phase image includes a three-dimensional representation of the microorganisms. The three-dimensional quantitative phase image is processed using a convolutional neural network with one or more three-dimensional convolutional layers. The neural network is configured to process the three-dimensional quantitative phase image in accordance with trained parameter values of the neural network to generate a neural network output characterizing the microorganisms. The predicted type of the microorganisms is identified using the neural network output.

In some implementations, the neural network output includes a respective probability value for each of a predetermined number of microorganism types. The probability value for a given microorganism type indicates a likelihood that the microorganisms are of the given microorganism type.

In some implementations, the predicted type of the microorganisms is identified as the microorganism type with the highest probability value in the neural network output.

In some implementations, the neural network output includes a probability value of a microorganism type that indicates a likelihood that the microorganisms are of the microorganism type.

In some implementations, the predicted type of the microorganisms is selected from the group consisting of genus, species, strain, gram-stainability, metabolism, morphology, and motility.

In some implementations, the three-dimensional quantitative phase image of the microorganisms is a three-dimensional refractive index tomogram.

In some implementations, the microorganisms are selected from the group consisting of bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and microalgae.

In some implementations, the microorganisms include bacteria that are present in a blood sample of a patient.

Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages.

The method described in this specification can enable microorganisms to be identified more rapidly and/or more consistently than some conventional methods.

For example, screening based on blood culture is a conventional method for identifying bacterial species. While blood culture can reveal the presence of the bacteria, it often takes hours to days for the bacteria to grow and form conspicuous colonies. Furthermore, mass spectroscopy or susceptibility tests against various antibiotics are typically used to determine the exact type of the bacteria. Other biochemical methods including the antiserum test, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarray, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can identify the type of the bacteria. However, due to their reliance on biochemical reactions or molecule-specific signals, these conventional methods may also involve hour-long to day-long processes as well as maintenance and use of specialized biochemical agents.

In contrast, the technology described in this specification can (in some cases) enable accurate bacterial identification in under an hour. For example, advances in microfluidic engineering and antibody engineering have achieved isolation of bacteria within an hour from concentrations as low as that of blood in a patient with a bacterial infection. Acquiring a 3D QPI of a bacterial sample need not involve time-consuming processes such as culturing or staining, and the classification neural network consumes milliseconds or less to make predictions using the input data.

The technology described in this specification may enable microorganisms to be identified more consistently than some conventional methods because it can be less vulnerable to human factors during both measurement and analysis. For example, while some conventional methods rely on physical experiments performed by people, the technology described in this specification can exploit consistent measurements (i.e., generated using quantitative phase imaging) using computational techniques (i.e., a classification neural network).

By processing 3D QPIs, the technology described in this specification can (in some cases) identify microorganisms more accurately than would be possible by processing 2D QPIs. In particular, 2D QPIs corresponding to particular illumination angles often include noisy image artifacts resulting from interference caused by multiple reflections or scattering by dust particles. Images of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) which are only hundreds of nanometers thick are especially vulnerable to such artifacts. The signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of a 3D QPI reconstructed from multiple 2D QPIs may be higher than the 2D QPIs because the noisy artifacts are illumination angle-dependent whereas the influence of microorganisms remains consistent.

By using a 3D convolutional neural network, the technology described in this specification can (in some cases) identify microorganisms more accurately than would be possible by using, e.g., a 2D convolutional neural network or other machine learning model. In particular, the 3D convolutional neural network can be trained to exploit complex 3D spatial relationships between different portions of a 3D QPI to accurately identify microorganisms depicted in the 3D QPI.

Certain details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

11903875	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to the field of glaucoma treatment. In particular, the present invention relates to a glaucoma implant device.

BACKGROUND ART

Glaucoma is a chronic disease whose progression closely correlates with increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Its management and control seek to preserve the visual field and is dependent on the possibility to control IOP. Most often glaucoma progresses in the older age, which makes the treatment being required for a median 13-16 years until natural death of the patient. There are a number of options available to physicians for glaucoma management and treatment algorithms are pretty well defined. The first choice is usually topical hypotensive eye drops. However, they put significant demands on patients (especially older aged) for administering compliance and frequently have negative side effects on the eye (such as irritation and inflammation), especially with treatment time passing.

Laser Trabeculoplasty is an effective treatment but its effects last for a relatively short time. Traditional glaucoma surgery is very effective in lowering TOP, but has significant risks related to surgery itself and complications later, followed by a relatively high failure rate (by some studies estimated to be up to 40-50% of cases in 5 years). Trabeculectomy, a bleb based golden standard, relies on ostia made by removal of part of the trabecular meshwork and adjacent structures for drainage into subconjunctival space. Tube based surgery relies on drainage via aqueous shunts which drain via encapsulated plate. Both procedures carry significant intrasurgical and postsurgical complications risk (such as hypo tony), which needs skilled surgeons' intervention and special handling. The failure of both procedures in long term are mostly related to the natural body reaction to heal wounds and to encapsulate foreign bodies. Various studies have demonstrated that pressure of aqueous into subconjunctival space rapidly induces serious fibrotic reaction, which is necessary for bleb to function as resistor on one side, but over time it may lead to increasing encapsulation and subsequent bleb failure. Therefore, in the future, bleb needling or another surgery might be needed for the patient. Since body reaction is highly individual, it is normally difficult to estimate success of the bleb.

These highly probable problems of fibrotic encapsulation and bleb failure in long term and probability of postoperative complications (such as hypotony) puts surgery options to the point of the last resort where potential benefit or absence of options outweighs the risks.

Next to these traditional techniques, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) implants are available as relatively new options filling the gap between drops and traditional surgery. Usually, the MIGS implants are manufactured by using subtractive precision manufacturing techniques, leading to tubular, straight line and round orifice designs. MIGS targeting Schlemm canal can be implanted ab interno, reducing surgery risks. However due to natural episcleral veins back pressure they cannot reduce TOP as effectively as traditional surgery, limiting the range of potential patients. MIGS targeting uveoscleral route of drainage are trying to give more control on subscleral bleb outcome or try to exploit suprachoroidal space. However, the presence of the bleb and/or penetration into the anterior chamber might lead to similar problems as trabeculectomy or to the new ones (such as endothelial cells loss due to presence of implant end in the anterior chamber).

It would therefore be desirable to have device capable of minimizing the drawbacks described above.

In particular, it would be desirable to have a device which could be used for defining a procedure which would potentially allow less risky, earlier (longer lasting) surgery, controllable implantation results, relatively low learning curve for implantation skills and low teens TOP reduction if needed.

Furthermore, it would be desirable to have a device capable of achieving a significant cost saving in production and assembly operations.

12016998	"The present invention relates to hand-held metered dose inhalers, also known as MDIs, and more particularly to improving the observance of treatment regimes involved in the use of hand-held metered dose inhalers to dispense a metered quantity of drug. Such metered dose inhalers generally comprise a hollow body, into which a cartridge is inserted. The cartridge contains the drug to be dispensed or delivered, and the drug is generally formulated in such a way that when the cartridge dispensing mechanism is activated, the drug is released as an aerosol of drug particles or drug solution particles suspended in a gaseous vehicle, or the solution of drug is finely dispersed when released from a high pressure environment, such as the cartridge, to a lower pressure environment, such as the ambient environment of the user of the device.

One of the biggest problems with such devices is that, although they distribute metered, i.e. known predetermined quantities of active drug substance, it is very difficult to know whether the drug has been dispensed or delivered in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer or health care specialists that prescribe the treatment. This can lead to circumstances where the drug is not inhaled correctly by the user, e.g. through lack of correct coordination between activating release of the drug and inhaling, or simply wasted, for example in the case of accidental delivery of the drug, or even overdosed, for example, because the user thinks that previous attempts to inhale the drug have failed or were unsatisfactory. As such devices are often used for long periods of time, e.g. to correct or treat long term respiratory conditions such as asthma, the incorrect administration and usage of such hand-held metered dose inhalers can lead to other, more serious problems.

Several attempts to exert greater control over the delivery of the drug to be inhaled and provide some measure of reassurance, feedback or comfort to the user have been proposed over the years. Most of these attempts have focused at either integrating sensors and circuitry directly into the hollow body that receives the cartridge containing the drug to be dispensed, termed here for ease of understanding as the “integrated approach”, or else relate to further devices that are added in some way onto the hollow body or cartridge. The latter solutions are termed “add-on” devices, because they can generally be added or removed from the hollow body, or cartridge, as and when needed, or say, for example, for cleaning or exchange of the device circuitry.

An example of the integrated approach is disclosed in European patent EP0617762. A hollow body is provided in which a drug dispensing cartridge is inserted, wherein the hollow body is equipped with an observance system, including visual and audible signals, and a display, to display messages to the user with regard to correct administration of the drug dispensed by the cartridge. The body is also provided with a channel or conduit, that allows for passage of air from the outside or ambient air, to pass through the hollow body and into a drug distribution mouthpiece outlet. Electronic sensor means are located within the channel in order to measure changes in air pressure flowing through the channel, and motion sensor means are provided for detecting if the canister is shaken prior to each actuation. The various signals obtained from the various sensor means are processed and relayed to the display to show an appropriate message to the user.

An example of the “add-on” device approach is disclosed in European patent EP0387222. This document describes a metered dose inhaler system that comprising a pressure filled canister and hollow body for containing said canister. The pressure canister is provided with a nozzle and is placed in a bracket with a nozzle. The bracket is shaped with a separable unit, which comprises a detector in connection with the air channel for the inhalation flow and an electronic unit. When the patient inhales from the mouthpiece, air flows are opened past the gap around the pressure canister and out through the mouthpiece. The patient has to, during the introductory phase of the inhalation, press the canister down, so that a dose is released through the nozzle. The air flow around the canister and the bracket give rise to a noise, which can be detected by a noise detector. When a dosage is released through the nozzle a sound arises, which can be distinguished from the noise and can be detected by the detector. Since these sounds are different from each other, a microphone can be used as detector. At inhalation through the inhaler according toFIG.7, a pressure drop is created between the ambient pressure and the pressure at the mouthpiece opening, i.e. a sub-pressure arises inside the bracket when the patient inhales, which sub-pressure can be detected by a pressure transmitter. At the release of a dose, a strong pressure change with short duration arises, which is also detectable by a pressure transmitter. In the embodiment according toFIG.7, a pressure transmitter can also be used for detection of both the inhalation and the release of a dose, i.e. the information necessary for controlling that the patient uses the dose aerosol in the prescribed way.

Unfortunately, the known solutions from the prior art are particularly complex to design and manufacture and fail to address a number of problems associated therewith. In particular, the known solutions from the prior art, such as the ones exposed above, fail to deal with the issue of being able to physically measure the number of pressurised drug releases from the cartridge or canister containing the aerosol drug, and accurately correlate that number with the data registered by the provided inhalation processing system. This problem becomes especially acute when, for example, the power supply for the data processing system is absent or depleted, as can happen when the processing and signalling system built into such devices is powered by a rechargeable battery, for example. In such moments, the metered dose inhaler will either be incapable of being operated by the user to administer required drug doses, essentially rendering the MDI useless, or else it will simply not register any drug released from the canister or cartridge with the processing system when the user activates it to administer a corresponding required dose of drug.

Prior to the emergence of MDI devices as described above having on-board data processing systems, releases of drug doses, i.e. the number of presses on the mechanical release system of the cartridge or drug container, were displayed visually via an opening provided in the body surrounding the canister or cartridge or drug container. These visual displays were often provided by a wheel or visual counter, that was moved mechanically and physically indexed to one or other of the moving parts involved in the release of a drug dose. However, these physically and mechanically connected visual displays were unable to provide any indication of actual drug inhaled, or any real notion of independent observance of a drug treatment regime.

One object of the handheld metered dose inhaler device of the present invention is therefore to provide a MDI device comprising a mechanically activated visual cue representing the number of doses expelled from or doses remaining in a drug-containing cartridge or canister, and a removable data processing system configured to verify the dose of drug administered and/or inhaled, wherein the MDI device further comprises correlation means configured to correlate physically released doses from the drug containing cartridge or canister with the administration and/or inhalation data stored in the removable data processing system.

Such a system overcomes the limitations and problems described above with regard to known prior art solutions. In addition, such a combination provides further advantages as follows:it becomes possible with the handheld device according to the invention to reduce the overall bulkiness of the cartridge holder body, whilst still being able to continue to use the handheld MDI device, making it suitable for use, for example, by children;it becomes possible for the data processing system of the MDI device, if such a system includes an autonomous power supply, to be recharged separately from the MDI device, or even exchanged should the data processing system become defective for whatever reason;the data processing system can be configured to synchronize the data stored therein with a remote observance system without having to be physically connected to the MDI device, leaving the MDI device available for continued use by the patient.

These and other advantages will become apparent as the further objects of the invention are exposed hereafter.

According to another object of the invention, the correlation system comprises mechanical activation means in contact with a drug containing cartridge of the MDI device, and wherein said mechanical activation means engage with translational movement conversion means configured to convert a translational movement of the mechanical activation means into a rotational movement. In typical metered dose inhalers, when the drug cartridge is activated to expel a dose of drug, a downwards press is made by the user on the top of the cartridge seated within the inhaler body, the downward press of the cartridge thereby depressing a spring-loaded valve, which opens into the drug cartridge, and said drug, being contained under pressure within the cartridge is released to the environment via the inhaler body and channeled via the user's mouth into the user's respiratory system. This mechanical activation means are in contact with at least a part of the drug cartridge so that when the cartridge is moved downwards by the user's press, it also moves in a generally downwards direction. The mechanical activation means of the correlation system thereby come into contact with or engage suitably disposed translational movement conversion means. The translational movement conversion means are configured to convert the generally downwards, translational movement of the pressed drug cartridge transmitted via the mechanical activation means into a rotational movement.

According to one object of the invention, the mechanical activation means in contact with a drug containing cartridge of the MDI device comprise a spring-loaded tongue having a first extremity and a second extremity, said first extremity engaging with a collar of said drug containing cartridge, and said second extremity engaging with the translational movement conversion means configured to convert a translational movement of the mechanical activation means into a rotational movement.

An example of a suitable mechanical activation means embodied by the spring loaded tongue above is, for example, and concretely, a spring-loaded caliper, or stirrup, which is seated in contact with a shoulder of the drug cartridge or canister, and held in contact therewith by a spring. The spring is seated at one end against a substantially horizontally projecting wall which extends from a substantially vertical body wall of the inhaler and maintains the tongue, or stirrup, against the body of the canister or cartridge in a relaxed or extended configuration. The tongue, or stirrup, sits over the circumference of the spring at another end thereof, and comprises at least one projecting tine that projects from a tongue or stirrup body into an inner axial bore defined by the helix of the spring. The stirrup further comprises a stirrup leg extending downwardly from the stirrup body, and outside of the circumference of the spring. At a lower extremity of the stirrup leg, a hooked, curved, or pointed tip is provided. Preferably, this stirrup leg, and optionally the stirrup leg tip, are made of a pre-constrained material, that enables the tongue, or stirrup leg and tip, to deform or flex in a desired and predetermined manner, for example, showing a degree of hysteresis. The second extremity of the tongue, herein exemplified as the stirrup leg tip, comes into contact, and engages with, a corresponding translational movement conversion means to convert said translational movement into a rotational movement when the canister is depressed or activated by the user.

According to yet another object of the invention, the translational movement conversion means comprises an axle shaft having a peripheral surface, said peripheral surface being engaged by the second extremity of the spring loaded tongue at each activation of the drug-containing cartridge or canister, and imparting a rotational movement to said axle shaft. In the embodiment described above, the tongue is exemplified by the stirrup leg and the stirrup leg tip corresponds to the second extremity of the tongue, which comes into contact with the peripheral surface of the axle shaft.

The rotating axle shaft is advantageously mounted substantially beneath the second extremity of the tongue, or as herein exemplified, the stirrup leg tip, and orthogonally in relation the direction of movement of the tongue or stirrup leg tip. Downward movement as described above, when the cartridge or canister is depressed, causes the spring to be compressed into a constrained configuration, and the tongue, or stirrup leg, moves down at the same time, bringing the second extremity of the tongue, i.e. the stirrup leg tip, into contact with the axle shaft. When pressure on the canister is released, in other words, usually when the user releases hand or finger pressure on the top of the canister, the tongue, or stirrup leg and tip, is/are moved back to their initial relaxed position away from the axle shaft under the effect of the seating spring recoil as the spring moves back to the unconstrained position.

The axle shaft further comprises an outer surface which comes into contact with the second extremity of the tongue, or as exemplified, the stirrup leg tip. Advantageously, this axle outer surface is sculpted or shaped to receive the second extremity of the tongue, or stirrup leg tip, as it moves downwards into contact with the axle surface, and upon further downward travel of the tongue, or stirrup leg tip, cause the axle to rotate about the axles axis of rotation. Each downward movement, in other words, each depression of the canister, coincides with a single travel distance of the tongue, or stirrup leg and tip, and a corresponding contact and transmitted angle of rotation of the axle shaft.

According to yet another object of the invention, the peripheral surface of said axle shaft is provided with a plurality of peripheral teeth projecting from said peripheral surface, a different tooth of the plurality of peripheral teeth engaging with said second extremity of said tongue at each activation of the drug-containing cartridge or canister. In order to ensure regular and a sufficiently consistent angular rotation of the axle shaft, the axle shaft outer surface is provided with a series of teeth. The gorges of the teeth thus provide at least one bearing surface with which the second extremity of the tongue, or as exemplified, the stirrup leg tip, can come into contact and push the axle shaft around its axis of rotation. The hooked, curved or pointed second extremity of the tongue, or stirrup leg tip, is shaped so that while it engages with the surface of the axle shaft during the downward movement, it disengages from said axle surface on the return, or upward movement, for example after the tip has passed a tangential point of contact on said axle shaft surface. This can be obtained as indicated above by making the stirrup leg, and/or tip, out of a pre-constrained, resilient and/or semi-flexible material with a smooth axle-surface facing surface such that, when the tip begins its return upward journey, the tip flexes away from the axle surface and slides over the latter without engaging said axle surface to rotate the axle in a reverse direction. In this way, a translational movement is not only converted into a rotational movement, but additionally, said rotational movement is a unidirectional rotation. Naturally, whilst the present invention has been described with the above configuration in mind, other mechanisms for converting translational movement into a suitable rotational movement can also be used and are considered to lie within the scope of the present invention.

According to another object of the invention, the correlation system further comprises at least a first rotational position sensor. The first rotational position sensor is configured to measure the angle of rotation through which the axle shaft has turned after a downward translational contact event from the stirrup leg tip. Advantageously, the first rotational position sensor is coupled in an appropriate way to the axle shaft, and even more advantageously, coupled in an indexed manner, so that any rotational movement of the axle shaft correlates directly to a precise measurable angle of rotation within the sensor.

According to yet another object of the invention, the correlation system further comprises at least a second rotational position sensor.

According to a still yet further object of the invention, the at least first rotational position sensor and/or the at least second rotational position sensor are configured to convert an angle of rotation into an electrical signal.

Whilst various ways of implementing the above are possible, the applicants have found that using a potentiometer as the first and/or second rotational position sensor is particularly advantageous as potentiometers convert rotational movements into electric potentials, the values of which can be stored in a suitable memory module provided, for example, on suitable small circuit board. In such a case, the potentiometer is advantageously a single-revolution rotary potentiometer, i.e. configured to only measure an angle of rotation up to a maximum of a single complete revolution of the potentiometer, or alternatively, a multi-revolution rotary potentiometer, i.e. configured to measure angles of rotation over several complete revolutions of the potentiometer. For example, the CS14 range of rotary potentiometers commercialized by the Spanish corporation ACP have been found to be suitable for use in the device of the invention. Rotary potentiometers as envisaged for use in the present application are provided with a generally central opening, into which is inserted the axle shaft of the translational movement conversion means. The outer, axle shaft surface engages with a switch in the potentiometer causing said switch to move in a substantially circular arc, thereby causing an electric potential to be generated. The electric potential is communicated to a circuit board comprising either a processing unit, and/or a memory module for storing the value of that electric potential. Each electric potential measured or registered from the potentiometer, which in turn is generated by corresponding rotational movement of the axle shaft, respectively corresponds to an angle of rotation. The calculated angles of rotation resulting from the measured electric potentials can thus be used to determine how many doses of drug have been expelled from the canister, as each downward press is converted to a rotational movement, and thus an electrical signal.

Of particular advantage is a configuration in which a first rotary potentiometer is a single-revolution potentiometer, and a second rotary potentiometer is multi-revolution potentiometer. By providing a suitable and appropriate connection between the two differently configured potentiometers, it is possible to calculate a whole range of angles and precision, including the number of revolutions that the axle shaft has been rotated.

Accordingly, and as will be understood from the above description, the translational movement conversion means, for example as indicated in the preceding paragraph, the axle shaft, is connected to the at least first rotational position sensor.

According to yet a still further object, the at least first rotational position sensor is configured to effect no more than one revolution of said sensor before a reset. In such a case, a single-revolution rotary potentiometer is preferred.

According to yet a still further object, the at least second rotational position sensor is configured to effect at least a plurality of revolutions of said sensor before a reset. In such a case, a multi-revolution rotary potentiometer is preferred.

According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the at least first rotational position sensor is mechanically connected to the at least second rotational position sensor, and a rotational movement imparted to said at least first rotational position sensor is communicated to said at least second rotational position sensor. The second rotational position sensor, when present, is thus preferably not mounted on the axle shaft, but is nonetheless mechanically connected to the first rotational position sensor. The mechanical connection between the first rotational position sensor and the second rotational position sensor provides for an indexation between said two position sensors, and preferably and advantageously the second rotational position sensor is indexed to the angle of rotation of the at least first rotational position sensor.

According to a still further object, the at least first rotational position sensor is connected to said at least second rotational position sensor via a visual display wheel mounted in coaxial rotational movement on said at least second rotational position sensor. In this case, the visual display wheel is for example mounted on an axle shaft that is inserted into a central opening of the second rotational position sensor. Thus any angles of movement that are translated to said second rotational position sensor via the mechanical connection between it and said first rotational position sensor are further communicated to said wheel, which rotates in tandem with the second rotational position sensor due to insertion of the wheel's axle shaft into the central opening of the second rotational position sensor.

According to still a yet further object, the visual display wheel comprises a wheel outer surface, a portion of which is visible through the body of the MDI, and wherein said wheel outer surface comprises markings representative of a number of doses remaining, or expelled, from the drug containing cartridge. In this manner, the user can instantly see how many doses of drug have been expelled, or remain, depending on how the device has been configured to count dose release.

According to yet another object, the correlation system further comprises a signal processing unit for processing signals received from the at least first rotational position sensor and/or the at least second rotational position sensor. The signal processing unit is configured for either receiving and storing values of electrical potential and/or angles of rotation generated by the at least first and/or second potentiometers, and/or for calculating angles of rotation from said electrical potentials. These values and/or angles are advantageously stored in a memory module provided within the body of the inhaler, for example located underneath the axle shafts.

According to yet a still further embodiment, the axle shaft of the translation conversion means further comprises a terminal toothed cog, located at an extremity of said shaft distant from said plurality of peripheral teeth. As mentioned above, and in accordance with another object of the invention, the axle shaft traverses and engages with an opening provided in said at least first rotational position sensor.

Furthermore, and according to a still yet further object, the toothed cog extends beyond the opening provided in said at least first rotational position sensor, such that said toothed cog is located outside of said at least first rotational position sensor. If one were to view the first positional sensor from the side, one would observe the axle shaft traversing the central opening of the sensor, and on the one side at an extremity of the axle shaft, the toothed cog standing proud, and ready to be engaged, and on the other side, the plurality of peripheral teeth disposed around a peripheral surface of the axle shaft.

As mentioned above, the first and second rotational position sensors are connected to each other via a mechanical connection. To that extent, a further object of the invention provides that the at least first rotational position sensor and the at least second rotational position sensor are connected to each other via a reducing gear having a first gear cog, a second gear cog, and an axle shaft connecting said first and second gear cogs, and on which said gear cogs are mounted at respective ends of said gear cog axle shaft, the first gear cog being located in mating and rotational contact with the toothed cog of the translational movement conversion means axle shaft, the second gear cog being located in mating and rotational contact with the visual display wheel. In this way, rotational movement of the translational movement conversion means axle shaft is transmitted via the toothed cog thereof to the first gear cog of the reducing gear. As the first gear cog is connected to the gear cog shaft, said shaft rotates as the toothed cog rotates, and causes the second gear cog to rotate accordingly. The second gear cog, being in rotating contact with the visual display wheel, causes said display wheel to rotate, thereby changing the reading of the dose expelled or remaining at the corresponding window. Additionally, as the visual display wheel is connected via a display wheel axle to the second rotational position sensor, said second sensor also generates a corresponding electrical potential, which can be measured or processed by the signal processing unit and optionally stored in memory.

According to yet a still further object, the removable data processing system comprises at least one air pressure sensor. This air pressure sensor can be advantageously configured to detect a change in air pressure when drug is inhaled by the user and/or expelled from the MDI. To this end, and according to yet another object, the at least one air pressure sensor is generally located within the body of the MDI device in proximity to an air flow passage.

According to yet another object of the invention, the at least one air flow passage is distinct from a passage for inhalation of expelled drug from the drug-containing cartridge. This is most advantageous compared to some known MDI devices which are equipped with air sensors, as including an air sensor in the inhalation passage itself can deleteriously affect drug flow in said inhalation passage, and furthermore lead to confusing or inaccurate readings of user inhalation, thereby reducing the accuracy of any observance data that might be collected from the presence of such an air pressure sensor.

According to yet a still further object of the invention, the removable data processing system is housed within a housing that is removable from and snap-fit insertable into, the body of the MDI device. In this way, it becomes possible to use the MDI even when the data processing system is not present, which is of significant advantage to most users of such devices, as they can rarely afford not to be able to use their inhalers, or nor can they generally afford to be obliged to switch from a purely manual inhaler device to an electronic MDI for the period of time that the electronic inhaler might be out of action for whatever reason.

According to a still yet further object of the invention, the housing for said removable data processing system further comprises an electrical contact for establishing an electrical contact with the correlation system when said housing is inserted in the body of the MDI device. The electrical contact of the removable data processing system is provided to enable an electrical contact between said removable data processing system and the collected data of the correlation system when the removable data processing system is re-introduced back into the MDI body, so that the data processing system can recover any such data from the correlation system and correct, register or calculate any changes in, say, the number of doses remaining and/or expelled, and the like.

To that end, and according to yet another object, the housing for said removable data processing system further comprises a power supply for supplying power to said data processing system and said correlation system. Such a power supply can be a portable power supply, for example, one or more suitable batteries, or a rechargeable battery system if such is deemed suitable and/or appropriate. Generally, a sufficient power supply can be provided through the use of a single battery, such as a lithium ion battery, of the type commonly found powering other low powered electrical devices such as watches, domestic smoke alarms, toys and the like.

The present application is based on PCT filing PCT/JP2019/018215, filed May 07, 2019, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to a DC/DC converter and a power conversion device.

BACKGROUND ART

A DC/DC converter that performs bidirectional power transmission between two DC power sources is described, for example, in WO2018/016106 (PTL 1). In the DC/DC converter in PTL 1, a first converter of a full bridge circuit is provided on the first DC power source side and a second converter of the full bridge circuit is provided on the second DC power source side with a transformer interposed therebetween. Furthermore, a first reactor is provided between a first winding of the transformer and the first converter, and a second reactor is provided between a second winding of the transformer and the second converter.

In PTL 1, step-up operation is performed using the first reactor or the second reactor when voltage of the first DC power source or the second DC power source is higher than voltage generated in the first winding or the second winding of the transformer, that is, when the step-up operation is necessary. On the other hand, the step-up operation is not performed when voltage of the first DC power source or the second DC power source is lower than voltage generated in the first winding or the second winding of the transformer, that is, when step-down operation is necessary.

In the DC/DC converter described in PTL 1, an operation mode of performing step-up operation (step-up charge) and an operation mode of performing step-down operation (step-down charge) in first power transmission (charge of the second DC power source) in which power is transmitted from the first DC power source to the second DC power source, and an operation mode of performing step-up operation (step-up discharge) and an operation mode of performing step-down operation (step-down discharge) in second power transmission (discharge of the second DC power source) in which power is transmitted from the second DC power source to the first DC power source, that is, in total, four operation modes can be switched according to the duty ratio representing power transmission.

CITATION LIST

Patent Literature

PTL 1: WO2018/016106

SUMMARY OF INVENTION

Technical Problem

Unfortunately, in the DC/DC converter described in PTL 1, as will be explained in detail later, a circulating current path including the transformer without passing through either the first DC power source or the second DC power source may be formed in the operation mode of performing step-down operation with both of the upper arm and the lower arm kept in the off state in one bridge circuit on the power receiving side.

As a result, conduction loss is caused by current passing through the transformer, the DC reactor, and the semiconductor element, in a period of time in which both of the first bridge circuit and the second bridge circuit output zero voltage. At the same time, switching loss occurs when the on/off of the upper and lower arms is switched in the other bridge circuit on the power receiving side in the step-down operation mode.

In particular, in the operation modes of step-down charge and step-down discharge, the power transmission amount is smaller than in the operation modes of step-up charge and step-up discharge, and the conduction loss in the circulating current path and the switching loss on the power receiving side have a larger impact, leading to reduction in power conversion efficiency.

The present disclosure is made in order to solve such a problem and an object of the present disclosure is to improve power conversion efficiency in step-down operation with a small power transmission amount while enabling step-up operation and step-down operation in a DC/DC converter that performs bidirectional power transmission between first and second DC power sources.

SOLUTION TO PROBLEM

In an aspect of the present disclosure, a DC/DC converter that performs bidirectional power transmission between a first DC power source and a second DC power source includes a transformer, a first converter, a second converter, and a control circuit. The transformer has a first winding and a second winding magnetically coupled. The first converter is connected between the first DC power source and the first winding. The second converter is connected between the second DC power source and the second winding. The first converter includes a first bridge circuit and a second bridge circuit connected in parallel to each other to the first DC power source. Each of the first bridge circuit and the second bridge circuit has a positive electrode-side switching element and a negative electrode-side switching element connected in series between a positive electrode and a negative electrode of the first DC power source. The first winding is connected between a connection point of the positive electrode-side switching element and the negative electrode-side switching element of the first bridge circuit and a connection point of the positive electrode-side switching element and the negative electrode-side switching element of the second bridge circuit. The second converter includes a third bridge circuit and a fourth bridge circuit connected in parallel to each other to the second DC power source. Each of the third bridge circuit and the fourth bridge circuit has a positive electrode-side switching element and a negative electrode-side switching element connected in series between a positive electrode and a negative electrode of the second DC power source. The second winding is connected between a connection point of the positive electrode-side switching element and the negative electrode-side switching element of the third bridge circuit and a connection point of the positive electrode-side switching element and the negative electrode-side switching element of the fourth bridge circuit. The control circuit performs on/off drive control of the respective positive electrode-side switching elements and the respective negative electrode-side switching elements of the first converter and the second converter. In first power transmission in which power is transmitted from the first DC power source to the second DC power source, in the first converter, the control circuit performs DC/AC power conversion by performing on/off drive control of the positive electrode-side switching element and the negative electrode-side switching element in each of the first bridge circuit and the second bridge circuit. In the first power transmission, in the second converter, when a first power transmission amount by the first power transmission is greater than a predetermined first reference value, the control circuit stops on/off drive of the positive electrode-side switching element and the negative electrode-side switching element in the third bridge circuit and performs on/off drive control of the positive electrode-side switching element and the negative electrode-side switching element in the fourth bridge circuit, whereas when the first power transmission amount is smaller than the first reference value, the control circuit performs AC/DC power conversion by stopping on/off drive of the positive electrode-side switching element and the negative electrode-side switching element in both of the third bridge circuit and the fourth bridge circuit.

ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION

According to the present disclosure, in a DC/DC converter that performs bidirectional power transmission between first and second DC power sources, while step-up operation and step-down operation is enabled, occurrence of circulating current between the first and second converters can be prevented by keeping the switching elements in the power receiving-side converter in the off state at the time of step-down operation. As a result, the power conversion efficiency in step-down operation with a small power transmission amount can be improved.

11860882	"CROSS-REFERENCE SECTION

The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 16/526,813, filed Jul. 30, 2019 and entitled “GUIDANCE-ATTRIBUTE CONTROLS IN A SEARCH SYSTEM”, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.

BACKGROUND

Users often rely on search systems to help find information stored on computer systems. Such search systems include search interfaces that provide options for refining search results. For example, a search system may provide standard search refinement features. Such standard search refinement features may include a predefined set of attribute a derived set of attributes, or simply provide values of the attributes of a plurality of search result items. With the ever-increasing use of search systems for retrieving electronically stored information, improvements in computing operations for search systems can provide more efficient refinement of search queries and other operations in search systems.

SUMMARY

Embodiments of the present invention relate to methods, systems and computer storage media for providing a search system with relevance-based search refinement. By way of background, conventional query refinement operations in search systems may lead to inefficient search system refinement user interfaces (“search refinement interface”) because the options provided may not be applicable to the search being performed, thus limiting how effectively a user may further refine or search via the search refinement interface. For example, standard refinement user interface features may be a predefined set of attributes (i.e., a standard set of item characteristics related to search result items), a derived set of attributes (i.e., characteristics of all returned search result items), or simply provide values of the attributes of returned search result items. Moreover, such a user interface may include several inapplicable attributes that may make the interface and search functionality cumbersome. As such, an alternative approach for providing search refinement interfaces to support efficient refinement of items in an item listing database would improve computing operations for ease of performing search refinement.

Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards improving search systems using relevance-based search refinement. In particular, relevance-based search refinement is provided using a refinement user interface having selectable guidance attributes. At a high level, guidance attributes are characteristics of a plurality of items having corresponding values. For example, guidance attributes are an identified ranked set of characteristics of items based on historical user interactions with the items. Further, relevance-based search refinement are provided using a guidance-attribute control (i.e., a user interface control object) having embedded selectable values of the selected guidance attribute. Upon selecting a guidance attribute, a guidance-attribute control is provided. The guidance-attribute control includes values of the selected guidance attribute such that a user can quickly select at least one of the values for use in refining search results. A selection of an embedded value can be received to cause execution of an embedded-value search operation. A first embedded-value search operation can be executed to identify a subset of the items using the selected value. Alternatively, a second embedded-value search operation can be executed to provide a dynamically updatable count of search results items that will be provided upon refinement of the search results items using the selected value. Accordingly, refinement user interfaces that support efficient refinement of items in an item listing database and improve computing operations for ease of performing search refinement are contemplated with embodiments of the present disclosure, as described herein.

In operation, in response to a search query, search result items are displayed on a search interface along with selectable guidance attributes. The guidance attributes are an identified ranked set of characteristics of items based on historical user interactions of users interacting with the search result items provided in response to the search query. Upon selection of a guidance attribute, a guidance-attribute control having embedded selectable values is displayed. A selection of an embedded value is received to cause execution of an embedded-value search operation.

In further operation, selectable guidance attributes are displayed. The guidance attributes are presented to refine items response to a search query. A selection of a guidance attributed is received from the guidance attributes. Based on receiving the guidance attribute, a guidance-attribute control corresponding to the guidance attribute is displayed. The guidance-attribute control is embedded with selectable values of the guidance attribute. Selecting a value initiates embedded-value search operations. The embedded-value search operations are selectively available in the guidance-attribute control based on the selected guidance attribute.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used in isolation as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

11972935	"BACKGROUND

In atomic layer deposition (ALD), a film is deposited layer by layer by successive dosing and activation steps. ALD is used to generate conformal films on high aspect ratio structures. In some ALD processes film deposition on the backside of the wafer is difficult to avoid because the film can be deposited through any gap accessing the wafer backside. Backside deposition is unwanted for a number of reasons, one of which is that excess film on the backside of the wafer is susceptible to flaking, e.g., during wafer transport. If flakes from the backside of the wafer come into contact with a wafer (either the same wafer or a different wafer), the wafer is contaminated and defects can result.

In capacitive coupled plasma chambers, a small gap is desired between the pedestal and the wafer. This gap induces impedance between the wafer and the pedestal that is sufficient to essentially drown out the impedance variations caused by variations of the pedestal surfaces on the micro scale. To create the small gap between the pedestal and the wafer, minimum contact area (MCA) features are used to create a level virtual offset place with supports that ensure a flat wafer plane. As noted above, the gap between the pedestal and the wafer provides access to the backside of the wafer and thereby facilitates film deposition on the backside of the wafer.

Pedestals used in conventional ALD and plasma-enhance chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) systems typically include multiple MCA features that are adjustable in height. The current pedestal design guidelines specify the use of enough MCA features to ensure that the support plane created by these features holds a wafer parallel to the pedestal. Indeed, a design is considered inadequate if the number of MCA features used allows for wafer deflection or sag. Thus, in some pedestal designs, more than 30 MCA features are used to support the wafer. In some instances during processing, the films deposit onto components of the chamber in which the deposition is carried out.

The present invention relates to a glass film-resin composite.

Background Art

In recent years, the weight reductions and thinning of display and lighting elements each using a liquid crystal display element or an organic EL, and of a solar cell have been advancing from the viewpoints of conveyability, storability, and a design property, and development toward continuous production by a roll-to-roll process has also been advancing. The use of extremely thin glass (hereinafter also referred to as “glass film”) has been proposed as a method of imparting flexibility to glass to be used in those elements and the like. The glass film has flexibility and can be wound in a roll shape, and hence can be processed by the roll-to-roll process. There has heretofore been a disclosure of, for example, a method including processing a polarizing plate, a transparent electrode, or the like on the glass film through use of the roll-to-roll process (e.g., Patent Literature 1).

A glass material originally involves a problem in that its handleability is poor owing to its brittleness, and the problem with handleability becomes remarkable in the glass film that is so thin as to be windable in a roll shape. In particular, the glass film involves a problem in that it is difficult to continuously produce and process the glass film without its breakage, though the glass film has an advantage in that the glass film can be processed by the roll-to-roll process.

11865090	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods of treating cancer by upregulating expression of endogenous tumor suppressive microRNA molecules, suitable pharmaceutical compositions and uses thereof.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNA molecules, which are endogenously expressed either ubiquitously or in a tissue-specific manner, and play an important regulatory role in various cellular processes. miRNAs are of about 21 nucleotides in length that are part of a mechanism that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression. In mammals, miRNAs are generally transcribed by RNA polymerase II and the resulting primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) contain local stem-loop structures that are cleaved in the nucleus. The product of this cleavage is one or more precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNAs are usually 70-90 nucleotides long with a strong stem-loop structure containing a 2 nucleotides overhang at the 3′ end. The pre-miRNA is transported to the cytoplasm by where the Dicer enzyme, which is an endoribonuclease of the RNase III family, further cleaves the pre-miRNA to release a 21 bp dsRNA, the miRNA duplex. The mature miRNA guides RISC to a target site within mRNAs. If the target site has perfect complementarity to the mature miRNA, the mRNA is cleaved at a position that is located about 10 nucleotides upstream from the 3′ end of the target site. After the cleavage, the RISC-mature miRNA strand complex is recycled for another activity. If the target site has lower complementarity to the mature miRNA, the mRNA will not be cleaved at the target site but the translation of the mRNA will be suppressed. In humans, there are about 2000 miRs expressed at levels that are expected to have biological significance. Each cell has a very different miR profile. Each gene could be regulated by a number of miRs, and each miR could regulate a number of genes. There are miRs that are expressed in specific cells and there are some that are expressed in a number of cell types. Over 90% of genes are affected by miRs for their expression upon measuring their protein products. Upon stress conditions, as in inflammation or cellular transformation, there is an increase in miRs expression. Various miRs have also been shown to have tumor suppressive effect.

Studies have shown that cells can secrete numerous types of vesicles of different sizes. Some types carry miRs that originate from the same cell source as the vesicles themselves. Exosomes are one specific type of vesicle of the size of 40-100 nm. Studies show that miR-122 produced in the liver targets erythropoietin mRNA in the kidney reducing its protein level in the kidney and blood (Rivkin M, et. al, Gastroenterology 2016; 151:999-1010). Another study has shown the inducement of secretion of miR-122 by free fatty acids (Chofit C. et. al. Gastroenterology 2017 Gastroenterology. 2017 November; 153(5):1404-1415).

Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, however, biomedicine faces a formidable and challenging barrier, the lack of new and effective anti-cancer therapeutics. The cost of developing a new anti-cancer drug is extremely costly and time consuming. The incidence of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for example, is increasingly causing mortality. There are multiple risk factors that cause chronic liver inflammation that induces the initiation and progression of HCC. The chronic inflammatory process, whether the etiology is infectious, metabolic or genetically based (e.g. Wilson Disease) causes genetic and epigenetic genome wide changes, including genomic instability. Yet, the current therapeutic options are mostly insufficient. They are mainly directed for focal/local HCCs and include liver transplantation, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and surgical resections. Both Sorafenib and Regorafenib improve survival only by a few months and have major side effects. The cost of developing a new anti-cancer drug is extremely costly and time consuming. Furthermore, many tumors develop resistance to the drugs, which can also exhibit major side effects.

Thus, there is a need in the art for selective, efficient and safe treatment of various types of malignant conditions, including treatment of metastases. In particular, there is a need in the art for anti-cancer treatment, which is host-based, thus having fewer side effects, safe for use, cost effective and does not induce tumor resistance and can successfully treat metastases.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention in embodiments thereof provides advantageous compositions for treating cancer in a safe, robust, and effective manner, with minimal side effects, without inducing tumor resistance and which can treat metastases as well. According to some embodiments, there are provided compositions comprising one or more agents (molecules) capable of increasing/inducing expression of endogenous tumor suppressive miRNAs in one or more producing cells, such that the expressed endogenous miRNAs can affect one or more target cancer cells. In some embodiments, there are provided methods of treating cancer using the agents capable of increasing expression of the endogenous tumor suppressive miRNAs.

According to some embodiments, the compositions and methods disclosed herein are advantageous, as they are host-based nature, and thus are very effecting, exhibiting anti-cancer effects and fewer side effects, with the administered miR-inducer-agent being the only “foreign” element. Additionally, due to the fact that each of the tumor suppressive miR simultaneously targets a number of molecular pathways, as well as multiple steps within a given pathway, it aids in overcoming a major obstacle of cancer therapy, being resistance. Additionally, different miRs can act simultaneously increasing their tumor suppression ability.

According to some embodiments, the present invention is based in part on the effects of tumor suppressive miRs, the intercellular communication systems involving vesicles of different sizes (such as exosomes and Ribonucleic Acid Protein complex (RNPs)) and the advantageous enhancement of the expression and secretion of the specific tumor suppressive miRs in producing cells, and the expansion of their effect on various target cells and tissues. Practically each cell in the body can produce miRNAs and miRNAs delivery vehicles to communicate in an autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine manner. The delivered miRNA acts on a remote cell upon the uptake of the delivery content of the exosome or other delivery systems of different sizes and nature e.g. RNPs. In this regard, miRNAs are functioning in many cases as “RNA hormones”.

According to some embodiments, there is provided a composition comprising one or more agents capable of increasing expression of one or more endogenous tumor suppressive miRNAs in one or more producing cells, such that the endogenous tumor suppressive miRNAs can affect one or more target cancer cells.

In some embodiments, the agent comprises a small molecule, a transcription factor, a drug, or combinations thereof.

Field of the Invention

Our invention relates to a storage bag. More specifically, our invention relates to a storage bag with features for maintaining the opening of the bag, and maintaining the opening to a size that is about equal to a size of the bottom end of the bag.

Related Art

Storage bags or pouches made from flexible plastic materials are well known. Such bags can be used to store a variety of items, with one of the most common uses being the storage of perishable food. In order to effectively preserve food, and in order to prevent food or other items from leaking out of a storage bag, the storage bag often includes a sealing mechanism for closing the opening of the bag. One common type of sealing mechanism, which is often referred to as a fastener assembly or a zipper, includes interlocking closure profiles at a top end of a bag. The interlocking closure profiles are pressed and pulled apart by a slider that is movable across the top end of the bag, thereby sealing and unsealing the opening of the bag. Examples of storage bags that include such a sealing mechanism are sold by the assignee of this application under the ZIPLOC® trademark.

In filling a storage bag, materials are passed through the opening to the interior of the bag. Given the usual size of storage bags, coupled with the inherent difficulty of manipulating some materials, it can sometimes be difficult for a person to maintain the opening of the bag open while directing materials into the bag. It is advantageous, therefore, to provide a storage bag with a structure to maintain the opening of the bag open. Further, it is advantageous to configure the bag such that the bag will stand upright during the filling operation.

One example of a structure for maintaining the opening of a storage bag open is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,364,361, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. In this patent, a storage bag includes a sealing mechanism that closes the opening. When unsealed, a biasing rail maintains the opening of the bag open. Thus, anytime the bag is unsealed, the opening of the bag will have a non-flat shape.

An example of maintaining the shape of an opening of a bag is shown in Japanese Patent Application Pub. No. 2005-88893. In this publication, a shape-retaining tape is provided adjacent to the mouth of a bag such that the mouth of the bag can be maintained in any shape. Apparently, in order to allow for differently shaped openings, and in order to allow the bag to be folded into different shapes, the bag set forth in Japanese Patent Application Pub. No. 2005-88893 does not include a sealing mechanism. In order to further allow the bag to be folded and formed into different shapes, the bag set forth in this publication does not have discernable sides or a bottom.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

According to one aspect of our invention, a storage bag is provided. The storage bag includes a first side surface and a second side surface connected to the first side surface so as to form an interior of the bag with an opening thereto. A first fastener strip is positioned adjacent to the opening of the bag, with the first fastener strip including at least one interlocking profile and a flange extending below the at least one interlocking profile. A portion of the flange is attached to the first side surface. A second fastener strip is positioned adjacent to the opening of the bag, with the second fastener strip including at least one interlocking profile and a flange extending below the at least one interlocking profile. A portion of the flange is attached to the second side surface. A slider is configured to press together the at least one interlocking profile of the first fastener strip and the at least one interlocking profile of the second fastener strip as the slider moves from the first end to the second end of the bag. The slider is also configured to separate the at least one interlocking profile of the first fastener strip and the at least one interlocking profile of the second fastener strip as the slider moves from the second end to the first end of the bag. A first shape-retaining strip formed from a shape-retaining material is provided between the flange of the first fastener strip and the first side surface of the bag, and a second shape-retaining strip formed from a shape-retaining material is provided between the flange of the second fastener strip and the second side surface of the bag.

A storage bag is provided according to another aspect of our invention. This storage bag includes a first side surface, and a second side surface connected to the first surface so as to form an interior of the bag with an opening thereto. A first fastener strip is positioned adjacent to the opening, with the first fastener strip including at least one first interlocking profile. A second fastener strip is positioned adjacent to the opening, with the second fastener strip including at least one second interlocking profile. A slider is configured to press together the at least one interlocking profile of the first fastener strip and the at least one interlocking profile of the second fastener strip as the slider moves from the first end to the second end of the bag. The slider is also configured to separate the at least one interlocking profile of the first fastener strip and the at least one interlocking profile of the second fastener strip as the slider moves from the second end to the first end of the bag. A first shape-retaining strip is positioned adjacent to the first fastener strip, and a second shape-retaining strip is positioned adjacent to the second fastener strip. The first and second shape-retaining strips are capable of maintaining a first position in which the opening of the bag is substantially closed with the first and second fastener strips positioned adjacent to each other. The first and second shape-retaining strips are also capable of maintaining a second position in which the opening of the bag is substantially open with the first and second fastener strips separated from each other.

A storage bag is provided according to yet another aspect of our invention. The storage bag includes a first side surface and a second side surface connected to the first surface so as to form an interior of the bag with an opening thereto. The first side surface is directly connected to the second side surface along a first end of the bag and a second end of the bag, and the first side surface is connected to the second side surface at a bottom end of the bag with a k-seal connection that is changeable between (i) a flat configuration with the first side surface positioned adjacent to the second side surface at the bottom end, and (ii) an expanded configuration with the first side surface spaced from the second side surface at the bottom end. A first fastener strip is positioned adjacent to the opening, with the first fastener strip including at least one interlocking profile. A second fastener strip is positioned adjacent to the opening, with the second fastener strip including at least one interlocking profile. A first shape-retaining strip is positioned adjacent to the first fastener strip, and a second shape-retaining strip is positioned adjacent to the second fastener strip. The first and second shape-retaining strips are capable of maintaining the opening of the bag such that a distance from the first side surface to the second side surface at the opening is about equal to the distance from the first side surface to the second side surface at the bottom end of the bag.

The present disclosure relates generally to small molecule modulators of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B and their use as therapeutic agents, for example, in treating diseases mediated thereby such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, frontotemporal dementia, and cancer.

BACKGROUND

Neurodegenarative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have a negative effect on the lives of millions of people.

The multi-subunit protein complexes eukaryotic initiation factor 2B and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 are required for protein synthesis initiation and regulation in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B is composed of five subunits (α, β, γ, δ, and ε), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 is composed of three subunits (α, β, and γ). Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that catalyzes the exchange of guanosine-5′-diphosphate (GDP) with guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP) on eukaryotic initiation factor 2, thereby allowing the GTP bound eukaryotic initiation factor 2 to bind to the initiating methionine transfer RNA and initiate protein synthesis.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B is active when complexed as a ten subunit dimer. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 is active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP. Moreover, when the a subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 is phosphorylated on serine 51, it inhibits and regulates the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B. In its phosphorylated form, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 remains in an inactive GDP bound state and translation initiation is blocked.

The interaction between eukaryotic initiation factor 2B and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 plays an important role in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Activation of this pathway leads in part to ATF4 (Activating Transcription Factor 4) expression and stress granule formation. Aberrant ISR activation is found in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, with a strong functional link to pathology characterized by the RNA-binding/stress-granule protein TAR DNA binding protein (TARDBP), also known as TDP43. Activation of eIF2B inhibits the ISR and ISR dependent stress granule formation and is found to be neuroprotective in multiple disease models.

Impairment of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B activity is correlated to activation of the ISR pathway that is implicated in a variety neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. Mutations in TDP43 and other RNA-binding proteins/stress-granule proteins alter stress-granule dynamics and cause ALS. Inhibition of the ISR pathway can block and promote the dissolution of stress-granules. In addition, mutations in the human eukaryotic initiation factor 2B subunits have been identified as causing leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM) and childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination (CACH). In VWM/CACH patients, white matter lesions severely deteriorate and neurological disorders are exacerbated after stresses, and their eukaryotic initiation factor 2B guanine nucleotide exchange activities are generally lower than normal.

Aspects described herein generally relate to the field of malware protection, and more specifically to leveraging environmental indicators used by malware anti-analysis and target filtering behaviors for malware protection.

BACKGROUND

Information security is an important aspect of enterprise organizations. Malware attacks (e.g., phishing attacks, cyberattacks, ransomware) on a company's systems trigger violations that can pave the way to compliance issues, disciplinary actions, and loss of reputation. Several current systems, as may be implemented by an enterprise organization, have perimeter layer controls in place that monitor and detect suspicious activity, but may involve a lot of manual human intervention. In addition, a drawback of these current systems is that there are no proactive measures in place to prevent malware execution if a computing device does get exposed to a malware program.

SUMMARY

Aspects of the disclosure provide solutions that address and overcome technical problems associated with malware deterrence in a computing network. Specifically, methods, devices, and systems as described herein may use environmental indicators associated with anti-analysis and target filtering mechanisms of a malware program for inoculating a computing network.

In accordance with one or more arrangements, a malware security platform may comprise at least one processor; and memory storing computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the malware security platform to perform one or more operations. The malware security platform may query a malware database to determine an environmental indicator based on analysis of a malware program in a sandbox environment, wherein the environmental indicator is used by at least one of an anti-analysis mechanism and a target filtering mechanism associated with the malware program to prevent execution in the sandbox environment. The malware security platform may generate, based on the environmental indicator, an inoculation message for transmission to one or more computing devices in a computing network. In an arrangement, the inoculation message may comprise the environmental indicator. The malware security platform may send, to the one or more computing device, the inoculation message. The inoculation message may cause the one or more computing devices to integrate the environmental indicator into corresponding computing environments of the one or more computing devices.

In some arrangements, the malware security platform may determine the environmental indicator based on: determining that the malware program has not executed within the sandbox environment, and determining that the environmental indicator corresponds to the sandbox environment. An environmental indicator may consist of any mutable or immutable aspect of a computer system, though it is typically an aspect which is profiled or otherwise inferred by an application/program (malicious or legitimate) in its decision making process on whether to execute.

In some arrangements, the environmental indicator may be at least one of: a registry entry in the sandbox environment; a file system structure of the sandbox environment; hardware information associated with the sandbox environment; or combinations thereof.

In some arrangements, the anti-analysis mechanism may prevent execution of malware program based on detection of a registry entry indicating a malware analysis application. In some arrangements, the target filtering mechanism may prevent execution of malware program based on detection of a registry entry indicating a specified keyboard language. In some arrangements, the environmental indicator may be a registry entry and wherein the integrating the environmental indicator comprises adding the registry entry to respective system registries of the one or more computing devices.

In some arrangements, the malware database comprises indications of a plurality of malware programs and associated environmental indicators.

In some arrangements, the malware security platform may present a user interface configured to receive user input for at least one of: modifying the malware database; selecting the one or more computing devices; or combination thereof.

In some arrangements, the malware security platform may receive information indicating that at least a second computing device in the computing network is infected with the malware program. The sending the inoculation message may be based on receiving the information.

In some arrangements, the malware security platform may determine whether the environmental indicator is within a predetermined percentile of environmental indicators, in the malware database, arranged in a priority order from lowest priority to highest priority. The sending the inoculation message may be based on determining that the environmental indicator is within the predetermined percentile of environmental indicators.

In some arrangements, the malware security platform may determine the priority order of the environmental indicators based on respective quantities of malware programs using the environmental indicators.

PCT/US2019/055629 claims the priority benefits of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/246,156 filed Jan. 11, 2019, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

BACKGROUND

This disclosure relates to a system, user interface, and method for interactive assessment of negative predictions generated by machine learning localization models. The teachings of this disclosure have applications in various fields, including in machine learning health care applications, such as examination of microscope slides, diagnosis of breast cancer in mammograms, or other types of cancer in other radiology modalities (e.g., X-ray, CT, MRI), photographic images (dermatology) and still others. The teachings also have applications in other areas, such as metallurgy, parts inspection, semiconductor manufacturing, and others, where a machine learning localization model is making a prediction based on an input image data set, the prediction is negative, and the user seeks to query the model further.

The use of machine learning models for several health care applications is described in the patent and technical literature. In one example, such models are developed to assist a pathologist in identifying the presence of disease in a 2D or 3D volumetric image of the patent or specimen derived from the patient. For example, the pathologist may be trying to determine if tumor cells (i.e., cancer) are present in a magnified digital image of tissue, such as for example lymph node tissue, breast or prostate cancer tissue obtained from a biopsy. As another example, a machine learning model may assist a radiologist in detecting cancerous cells in a mammogram or chest X-ray. The machine learning models are trained to recognize cancerous cells or tissue from a set of training data (image sets), typically using convolutional neural networks or other classification procedures which are known in the art.

Various techniques and tools are known which address the problem of “model explanation.” Model explanation is a process of justifying, in a human-readable manner, why a machine-learning model made a certain recommendation (e.g. diagnosed a patient with cancer).

Deep-learning model predictions are notoriously difficult to explain. This is tolerable in use cases such as YouTube video rankings, but completely unacceptable for use cases in high impact applications such as medicine. Pathologists, and other medical professionals, prefer to know not only what the model prediction is, but also why if is so, in order to have confidence in the prediction.

Researchers for the present assignee have developed some basic methods for explaining a model prediction. For example, if a sample or image is diagnosed as “positive” (e.g. has cancer, or high likelihood of cancer), the following methods have been used: (1) a bounding box around a suspected lesion as produced by a detection model and later classified by a classification model is presented to the user, example shown inFIG.1A; (2) “heat maps”, typically with color coding to show degree of confidence of likelihood of particular regions or pixels being cancerous, are presented, example shown inFIG.1Band (3) attention masks are presented to the user, an example of which is shown inFIG.1C.

Despite these advances, options for explaining the lack of a finding (e.g. no cancer) are limited, as it is hard to prove a negative. With most computer-aided detection systems, a medical professional/pathologist/radiologist who believes that a certain region of interest is suspicious of a disease has no way of knowing whether the model producing a negative prediction missed that region or whether the model examined the region and classified it as normal/benign. Due to limited computational resources, in some implementations of machine learning in this domain, a detection model is used initially to find suspected cancerous tissue and only those regions found by the detection model are subsequently classified with a classification model. Accordingly, there is some risk that the detection model may have missed an areas that is potentially cancerous and that therefore the overall resulting prediction of “negative” may not be correct.

This problem of model explanation, in the context of a “negative” prediction, has led many Computer Aided Detection/Diagnosis (CAD) systems existing on the market to fail to deliver improved results. For example, mammography CAD systems have been shown to decrease specificity, partly because such systems employ user interfaces that, while they alert the radiologist with a multitude of findings, fail to assure the radiologist that findings which the radiologist identified themselves as suspicious were deemed benign by the machine learning model. This disclosure addresses this unmet need.

SUMMARY

In one aspect, a method is disclosed for assessing machine learning model providing a prediction as to the disease state of a patient from 2D or 3D imagery, e.g., an X-ray, CT scan, pathology specimen, of the patient or a sample obtained therefrom. The machine learning model is trained to make a prediction from the 2D or 3D imagery, e.g., cancerous, benign, calcification, lesion, etc. The method includes steps of: a) presenting an image with a risk score or classification associated with the prediction, wherein the image is further augmented with highlighting to indicate one or more regions in the image which affected the prediction produced by the machine learning model; b) providing a user interface tool for highlighting one or more regions of the image, c) receiving a user input highlighting one or more regions of the image; d) subjecting the highlighted one or more regions to inference by the machine learning model; and e) presenting the results of the inference on the one or more regions to the user via the display.

In another aspect, a workstation is described which is configured to assess a machine learning model providing a prediction of a patient from 2D or 3D imagery. The workstation includes a) display for displaying the image of the patient or a sample obtained therefrom along with a risk score or classification associated with the prediction, wherein the image is further augmented with highlighting to indicate one or more regions in the image which affected the prediction produced by the machine learning model; and b) a user interface tool by which the user may highlight on the display one or more regions of the image which the user deems to be suspicious for the disease state, wherein the user invokes the tools to thereby highlight the one or more regions. The display is further configured to present the results of inference performed by the machine learning model on the one or more regions highlighted by the user.

11910906	"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to nail polish containers. More specifically, when an operation button is pressed, the nail polish liquid in the container is sucked and temporarily stored before being applied to the fingernails or toenails. Therefore, the invented nail polish container prevents nail polish liquid from being excessively dribbled onto the Brush Body or repeatedly inserting and withdrawing the Brush Body into or out of the container to apply the nail polish liquid to fingernails or toenails.

In general, a nail polish container stores nail polish liquid inside its container with a bottleneck-shaped thread at the top and consist of a brush-attached support rod at the bottom center of the stopper, which is also used as a handle and fitted into the bottleneck-shaped thread.

When using conventional nail polish containers of this configuration, a user opens the handle by turning and pulls out the brush-attached support rod at the bottom of the lid and then applies the nail polish liquid solution to the fingernails or toenails by rubbing the brush provided at the bottom of the pulled-out handle.

However, conventional nail polish containers are inconvenient in that a user has to frequently apply nail polish liquid to the brush provided at the bottom of the support rod when applying nail polish liquid to fingernails or toenails for caring. In addition, a user had to repeat the process of frequently inserting or withdrawing the brush in and out of the container to apply the nail polish liquid to the brush. Conventional containers incur disadvantages in this process, including cases where the nail polish liquid absorbed in the brush accidentally gets on hands or clothes.

Various techniques have been devised to solve these disadvantages of such conventional nail polish containers.

For example, a nail-polishing application, the registered utility no. 20-0262434, has been devised. As a nail care device which applies nail polish liquid to fingernails or toenails, this product is mainly formed with 1) a Container Body that stores the nail polish liquid and is compressed by external pressure to discharge the nail polish liquid through the outlet provided at one end and 2) a first female thread on the inner periphery of the lower part, which connected to the first male thread on the top of the Container Body. A tubular-shaped connecting member with a tapered brush-rod insertion groove protruding from the upper portion of the container is coupled to the brush-rod insertion groove of the connecting member by fitting. The product is structured with several additional parts: 1) a brush rod with a brush-connecting groove of a specific shape to install the brush on the top; 2) a plurality of nail-polish outlet holes to eject specific amounts of nail polish liquid through the brush-connecting groove from the inside bottom of the brush rod, 3) a specifically-shaped lid, screwed to a second female thread formed inside the top of the connecting member, which surrounds the brush rod and has specific amounts of nail polish liquid embedded to prevent the brush from hardening. This product is designed to discharge a certain amount of nail polish liquid through the brush rod attached to the top, allowing more convenient and manageable nail polishing.

However, there is also a problem with this existing technique. When applying the nail polish liquid to fingernails or toenails, a user presses the container to deliver the nail polish liquid on the brush and then turns the container over. Therefore, the brush is positioned downward, and the nail polish liquid in the container leaks out to the brush side when the container is turned upside down.

In addition, since a user has to press the Container Body holding the nail polish liquid to deliver the nail polish liquid to the brush, if the pressure of the container is relatively strong and not carefully controlled, an excessively amount of nail polish liquid tends to be extracted to the brush.

SUMMARY

In this invention, an Elastic Pressing Body is provided on the Lid Body covering the container. The nail polish liquid in the container is sucked and temporarily stored in the Storage Body by pressing this Elastic Pressing Body. After removing the Lid Body from the container, press the Elastic Pressing Body again to transfer the temporarily stored nail polish liquid to the Brush Body so that it is absorbed in the Brush Body.

The present invention aims to provide nail polish containers which can significantly improve usability and convenience by 1) preventing excessive nail polish liquid from being discharged by delivering a certain amount of nail polish liquid to the Brush Body and 2) making unnecessary the actions of repeatedly inserting and withdrawing the Brush Body in and out of the container by using the nail polish liquid stored in the Storage Body when applying to fingernails or toenails.

As a means to attain the above purpose, a nail polish container of the present invention is primarily composed of a nail polish liquid Container Body, a Lid Body covering the top of the Container Body, and a Brush Body applying the nail polish liquid from the Container Body to fingernails or toenails. The Brush Body is provided with a Storage Body for storing the nail polish liquid, an Air Suction Unit in the Lid Body interlinked with the Storage Body, and an Elastic Pressing Body. When the Air Suction Unit is pressed and stopped, the air inside the Storage Body is sucked into the Air Suction Unit, and the nail polish liquid contained in the Container Body is supplied to the Storage Body and stored. After the Lid Body is separated from the Container Body, when the Elastic Pressing Body is pressed, the nail polish liquid supplied to the Storage Body is discharged and absorbed in the Brush Body.

In addition, the Brush Body is provided with a brush at the bottom of the inner Brush Space and brush support with a hollow inside. The inside of the Storage Body is provided as a storage, a Suction Inlet located in the Brush Space is interlinked with the storage at the lower end, and a Fitting Jaw is at the upper end.

The Air Suction Unit, elastic rubber or silicone material, is provided with a Fitting Groove into which the Fitting Jaw of the Storage Body is fitted and an Air Compression Space is interlinked with the storage of the Storage Body, respectively. The Elastic Pressing Body is provided with an Elastic Hook that covers the top of the Lid Body and a Pressing Protrusion at both lower ends of the Elastic Hooks and is in close contact with the outer surface of the Air Suction Unit.

In addition, the Lid Body is provided with a Stopping Jaw, and the lower end of the Air Suction Unit is provided with a Stopping Flange for fixing the Air Suction Unit to the Lid Body by being hooked on the Stopping Jaw.

In addition, the upper end of the Lid Body is provided with a Seating Hole in which the Elastic Hook of the Elastic Pressing Body is seated. Fixing holes are provided on both sides of the Seating Holes, respectively. An Elastic Hook seated in the Seating Hole and a Receiving Space in which the Pressing Protrusion is positioned and received on the elastic hanger are provided on the outer surfaces of both sides of the Lid Body. Fixing protrusions for fixing the Elastic Pressing Body to the Lid Body by being fitted into the Fixed Hole are respectively provided on the inner surface of the Elastic Hook of the Elastic Pressing Body.

In the present invention, the nail polish liquid in the Container Body is sucked into the Storage Body and stored by the air pressure difference generated when the Elastic Pressing Body is pressed and released. After the Container Body and Lid Body are separated, when the Elastic Pressing Body is pressed, a certain amount of the nail polish liquid stored in the Storage Body is discharged to the Brush Body to be absorbed into the brush, making it easier for a user to apply the nail polish liquid to fingernails or toenails.

This process prevents excess nail polish liquid from being delivered to the Brush Body and makes unnecessary the repeated action of inserting or withdrawing the Brush Body into or out of the container to apply the nail polish liquid to fingernails or toenails.

The present invention relates to the field of aircraft turbojet engines and is more particularly directed to a deicing device for an air intake of an aircraft turbojet engine nacelle.

BACKGROUND

In a known manner, an aircraft comprises one or more turbojet engines to allow its propulsion by acceleration of an air stream which circulates from upstream to downstream in the turbojet engine.

With reference toFIG.1, a turbojet engine100extending along an axis X and comprising a fan101rotatably mounted about axis X in a nacelle comprising an external shell102in order to accelerate an air stream F from upstream to downstream is represented. Hereinafter, the terms upstream and downstream are defined with respect to the circulation of air stream F. The turbojet engine100comprises at its upstream end an air intake200comprising a cavity204, annularly extending about axis X, which comprises an internal wall201facing axis X and an external wall202which is opposite to the internal wall201, the walls201,202are connected by a leading edge203also called an “air intake lip”. Thus, the air intake200allows the incoming air stream F to be separated into an internal air stream FINT guided by the internal wall201and an external air stream FEXT guided by the external wall202. Hereinafter, the terms internal and external are defined radially with respect to axis X of the turbojet engine100.

In a known way, during a flight of an aircraft, due to the temperature and pressure conditions, ice is likely to accumulate at the leading edge203and the internal wall201of the air intake200and to form blocks of ice which are likely to be ingested by the turbojet engine100. Such ingestions have to be avoided in order to improve the life time of the turbojet engine100and to reduce malfunctions.

In order to eliminate the accumulation of ice, still referring toFIG.1, it is known to circulate a hot air stream FAC in the internal cavity204in order to heat the internal wall201by thermal convection and thus avoid accumulation of ice which melts as it accumulates.

The introduction of the hot air stream FAC into the internal cavity204is carried out by an injector300which is conventionally in the form of a tube with a cylindrical cross-section which is oriented in a direction tangential to the axis of the turbojet engine as illustrated inFIG.2. The hot air stream FAC moves circumferentially through the internal cavity204in order to heat the internal wall201.

In practice, the energy efficiency of such heating is low as the hot air stream FAC also heats the external wall202, which represents a heat loss. In fact, with reference toFIG.3, when the hot air stream FAC is injected, it comes directly into contact with the external wall202, which captures a large part of the heat from the hot air stream FAC as it is guided into the internal cavity204. Therefore, to allow optimal heating of the internal wall201, it is necessary to inject a superheated air stream FAC into the internal cavity204. An immediate solution to eliminate this drawback would be to change the orientation of the injector300in the internal cavity204in order to target the internal wall201. However, such an immediate solution does not provide uniform heating of a circumferential external wall202. In the best case, this solution results in a displacement of the contact zone of the hot air stream FAC with the external wall202, which thus remains present.

One of the purposes of the present invention is to enable heating of the internal wall201of the air intake200of a turbojet engine nacelle with improved energy efficiency.

Incidentally, a twisted hot air stream injector is known from patent application CA2689195. From patent application FR2813581, there is known an injector for a twisted hot air stream and an axial hot air stream in a concentric manner in order to form a hot air stream having symmetry along the axis of the injector mouthpiece in order to heat indifferently the walls of the internal cavity.

SUMMARY

The invention relates to a deicing device for an air intake of an aircraft turbojet engine nacelle extending along an axis X in which an air stream circulates from upstream to downstream, the air intake comprising an internal cavity annularly extending about axis X, which has an internal wall facing axis X and an external wall which is opposite to the internal wall, the walls being connected by a leading edge, the deicing device comprising at least one injector of a hot air stream into the internal cavity, the injector comprising a mouthpiece extending along a mouthpiece axis.

The invention is remarkable in that the mouthpiece is configured to inject a hot air stream having an asymmetry along the mouthpiece axis so as to generate turbulence in the vicinity of the external wall while heating the internal wall. In other words, the hot air stream has not a symmetry of revolution about the mouthpiece axis. This advantageously makes it possible to heat the internal wall and the external wall of the internal cavity differently in order to maximise heat exchange with the internal wall and minimise it with the external wall. Thus, heating of the internal wall is optimal.

Preferably, the mouthpiece comprises at least one first channel configured to lead a first elementary stream and at least one second channel configured to lead a second elementary stream so as to form the hot air stream. The channels are superimposed, that is not concentric with each other. By virtue of the invention, the mouthpiece makes it possible to form a first elementary stream dedicated to the external wall and a second elementary stream dedicated to the internal wall so as to allow differentiated heating. Advantageously, the pressure differential creates, in the zone of mixing the elementary streams FE1, FE2, a deflection of the hot air stream FAC by the Coanda effect.

Preferably, the first channel comprises at least one air deflection member. Preferably, the air deflection member is configured to twist the first elementary stream. According to a preferred aspect, the air deflection member has a helical shape. Thus, the twisted first elementary stream allows to generate turbulence which allow, on the one hand, to limit heat exchanges with the external wall of the cavity and, on the other hand, to carry out a twisting of the first elementary stream in order to promote circumferential circulation in the annular internal cavity.

Preferably, the second channel is devoid of an air deflection member so as to provide a second elementary stream substantially axial.

According to a preferred aspect, the mouthpiece comprises a separating member to separate the mouthpiece between the first channel and the second channel. In other words, the mouthpiece consists of two channels. Preferably, the separating member is in the form of a substantially flat wall, preferably parallel to the mouthpiece axis. Thus, the elementary streams are guided independently in the mouthpiece so as to allow two different guide ways. According to a preferred aspect, the mouthpiece comprises only two channels.

Preferably, the first channel is convergent from upstream to downstream in order to accelerate the first elementary stream. Preferably, the second channel is convergent from upstream to downstream in order to accelerate the second elementary stream.

The invention also relates to an air intake of an aircraft turbojet engine nacelle extending along an axis X in which an air stream circulates from upstream to downstream, the air intake comprising an internal cavity, annularly extending about axis X which comprises an internal wall facing axis X and an external wall which is opposite to the internal wall, the walls being connected by a leading edge, the air intake comprising a deicing device, as previously set forth, in which the first elementary stream is configured to be injected on the side of the external wall of the internal cavity. Preferably, the second elementary stream is configured to be injected on the side of the internal wall of the internal cavity.

Preferably, the first elemental stream is radially external to the second elemental stream.

The invention also relates to a method for using a deicing device as set forth above for deicing an air intake of an aircraft turbojet engine nacelle extending along an axis X in which an air stream circulates from upstream to downstream, the air intake comprising an internal cavity, annularly extending about axis X, which comprises an internal wall facing the X axis and an external wall which is opposite to the internal wall, the walls being connected by a leading edge, the method comprising a step of injecting a hot air stream having an asymmetry along the mouthpiece axis so as to generate turbulence in the vicinity of the external wall while heating the internal wall.

A resonator is a device or system that naturally oscillates at frequencies called resonant frequencies. Resonators can be, for example, crystal resonators (also known as quartz resonators), inductance-capacitance (LC) resonators, or microelectromechanical system (MEMS) resonators. Resonators are generally passive devices that are combined with active circuitry to create an oscillator. The oscillator produces a periodic signal at the resonant frequency. A crystal oscillator, for example, is an electronic circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. Crystal oscillators may be used to generate frequencies to keep track of time or to generate a clock signal for digital integrated circuits. MEMS resonators may be used in place of crystal resonators to keep track of time and to generate a stable clock signal for analog and digital integrated circuits.

11945467	"BACKGROUND

Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

Autonomous vehicles or vehicles operating in an autonomous mode may use information provided by sensors. Each of the vehicles may include a computing device to process information received from vehicle sensors to avoid obstacles and ensure proper navigation. Such vehicles are typically equipped with various types of sensors in order to detect objects in the environment. For example, an autonomous vehicle may include lasers, sonar, radar, cameras, and other sensors which scan and record data from the surroundings of the vehicle. Sensor data from one or more of these sensors may be used to detect objects and their respective characteristics (position, shape, heading, speed, etc.). This detection and identification is useful for the operation of autonomous vehicles.

In order to accurately detect the environment surrounding the vehicle, the vehicle sensors may require calibration. Calibration of the vehicle sensors may be performed by capturing data of calibration targets positioned at known distances relative to the sensors, capturing data of calibration targets having known reflectivity patterns, and/or capturing data of calibration targets having predetermined symbols in predetermined arrangements. Such calibration targets may be referred to herein as “ground-truth calibration targets.”

Using the captured data generated from the sensors observing the ground-truth calibration targets, modifications may be made in hardware and/or software to account for discrepancies between the known calibration targets and the data measured using the sensors. Such ground-truth calibration techniques may take place at pre-specified temporal intervals (e.g., calibration may be performed every day, every week, every month, etc. for a particular sensor). Further, such calibration techniques may be performed in the location that houses the calibration equipment. For example, a specific garage may have multiple arrangements of calibration targets used to calibrate the different sensors of a vehicle.

After calibration, the vehicle may operate one or more of the recently calibrated sensors in run-time to perform object detection and avoidance. However, over time, the quality of the calibration of the sensors may degrade (e.g., because of mechanical shifts that arise within the optics of a sensor due to heat or jostling caused by uneven road surfaces). In order to correct for such degraded calibration, check-up or follow-up calibrations may be performed. Because only certain locations may house the equipment to perform ground-truth calibrations (e.g., using the ground-truth calibration targets), it may be onerous for the vehicle to perform such check-up or follow-up calibrations (e.g., it may be a long distance back to the calibration garage and/or only a certain number of vehicles can use the calibration garage at a time, thereby resulting in a long wait time for calibration during which the vehicle cannot be in use).

SUMMARY

The present application discloses embodiments that relate to apparatus and methods for detecting objects in the environment and identifying one or more candidate objects from the detected objects for use as proxy calibration targets to perform calibrations. The one or more candidate objects may be used as calibration targets to verify, validate, test, and/or calibrate sensors of vehicles. For example, vehicles may include one or more sensors (e.g., lidar sensors, radar sensors, sonar sensors, cameras, etc.) configured to capture portions of the environment surrounding the vehicle. Each of the vehicles may include a computing device configured to detect objects (e.g., buildings, walls, features, landmarks, stationary objects, validation or calibration targets, etc.) within the environment of the vehicle and identify one or more candidate objects from the detected objects for use as proxy calibration targets. The vehicles may be configured to send the information associated with the one or more candidate objects to a remote device (e.g., a remote server or another vehicle) for use in calibrating vehicle sensors.

A vehicle may be configured to receive the information associated with the one or more candidate objects from the remote device (e.g., a remote server). The vehicle may be configured to obtain the location of the one or more candidate objects from the received information and navigate to the location. Once the vehicle is near the one or more candidate objects, the vehicle can scan and/or capture the one or more candidate objects using the sensors of the vehicle. The vehicles may then compare the captured information associated with the one or more candidate objects with the information received from the remote device about the one or more candidate objects. The vehicle can be configured to use the comparison for calibrating, aligning, repairing, testing, validating, and/or verifying the performance of the sensors of the vehicle.

In one aspect, a method is provided. The method includes collecting, using a sensor coupled to a vehicle, data about one or more objects within an environment of the vehicle. The sensor has been calibrated using a ground-truth calibration target. The method also includes identifying, based on the collected data, at least one candidate object, from among the one or more objects, to be used as a proxy calibration target for other sensors coupled to vehicles within a fleet of vehicles. Further, the method includes providing, by the vehicle, data about the candidate object for use by one or more vehicles within the fleet of vehicles.

In another aspect, a method is provided. The method includes receiving, by a first vehicle within a fleet of vehicles, data about a proxy calibration target. The proxy calibration target has been characterized using a second sensor coupled to a second vehicle within the fleet of vehicles. The second sensor has been calibrated using a ground-truth calibration target. The proxy calibration target has also been identified, from among one or more objects, by the second sensor, as a candidate target for proxy calibration. The method also includes calibrating the first sensor using the data about the proxy calibration target.

In an additional aspect, a method is provided. The method includes receiving, by a proxy calibration target server, data about a candidate object within an environment. The data about the candidate object is usable by a fleet of vehicles to perform proxy calibrations. The data about the candidate object has been determined by a first sensor coupled to a first vehicle within the fleet of vehicles. The first sensor has been calibrated using a ground-truth calibration target. The candidate object has been identified, by the first sensor, from among one or more objects for use as a proxy calibration target. The method also includes providing, by the proxy calibration target server, the data about the candidate object to one or more vehicles within the fleet of vehicles.

These as well as other aspects, advantages, and alternatives will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with reference, where appropriate, to the accompanying drawings.

12071758	"TECHNICAL FIELD

The disclosure relates generally to stormwater systems, and more particularly, to end caps for stormwater chambers and methods for making end caps for stormwater chambers.

BACKGROUND

Stormwater management systems are used to manage and control stormwater, for example, by providing stormwater chambers for retention or detention of stormwater. As such, stormwater chambers may be provided underground where the chambers capture, filter, and/or contain the stormwater until it is deposited in the ground or an off-site location. Such systems, often buried underground, are subject to the stresses and strains imparted by surrounding layers of soil, gravel, and other materials. Further, wheel loads and track loads from heavy equipment during construction may cause stresses and strains on the chamber in addition to the stresses and strains from repetitive wheel loads by vehicles operated over the top of the finished site.

The weight of these surrounding layers exacerbated by the live loads described above may negatively affect the performance of drainage systems by deforming portions of the stormwater chambers, such as one or more end caps. Furthermore, replacing portions of the stormwater chambers, such as the end cap, can be both time consuming and expensive due to the location of the stormwater chambers. Accordingly, a need exists for stormwater systems and methods that address these drawbacks.

SUMMARY

In one embodiment, a corrugated end cap may comprise a corrugated frame comprising one or more corrugations defined by one or more sets of alternating peaks and valleys; one or more ribs disposed in one or more of the valleys and configured to increase a resistance of the frame to bending; and one or more valley reinforcements disposed in the valleys and running over a top surface of the corrugated frame.

The one or more ribs may be disposed at an angle relative to corresponding one or more of the peaks based on dimensions of a pipe configured to fit into the end cap.

The top surface, a front surface, and a rear of the corrugated frame may surround a recess configured to receive latch ridges from a stormwater chamber.

11977534	"FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention relates to document processing, and more specifically, this invention relates to computerized analysis of documents to detect tables therein, including single and multi-page tables, as well as tables having diverse layouts, formatting, content and/or terminology; extraction of such tables and/or content depicted therein from documents; and/or classification of tables, and/or portions thereof (especially columns) according to relevancy for downstream applications.

BACKGROUND

Documents, especially “large” documents like financial reports, medical charts, benefits documents, etc. often contain large volumes of diverse data. The data are diverse with respect to the formatting, content, extent (e.g., single/multi-page), and/or layout, even among similar document types (e.g., prepared by different entities and/or according to different conventions, organizational schemes, languages, etc.).

Accordingly, it would be useful to provide systems, methods, and computer program products capable of computerized analysis of documents to detect tables therein, including single and multi-page tables, as well as tables having diverse layouts, formatting, content and/or terminology; extraction of such tables and/or content depicted therein from documents; and/or classification of tables, and/or portions thereof (especially columns) according to relevancy for downstream applications.

Indeed, there has been a long-felt need in the field of document analysis and processing for techniques, especially automated, computerized techniques, for processing and analyzing the tabular information within documents, especially when such tables span multiple pages of a document, and/or exhibit unique/diverse structure, information layout, content, terminology, etc.

The concept of table analysis, extraction, and analysis of information therefrom, has existed for decades. However, efforts to-date to solve this problem have heretofore been limited in scope and/or accuracy and require substantial assumptions regarding the nature of table(s) and/or data contained therein. Often, these assumptions require tedious and/or complex user guidance and analysis that is typically very specific to a single kind of table to be targeted, thus limiting the applicability of any given extraction approach.

For instance, assumptions about table(s) and/or documents containing tables typically include and/or relate to one or more of: table structure (i.e., physical organization/layout of the table, such as a grid of graphical lines defining cells, an arrangement of data with columns/rows separated by whitespace (but no graphical lines), cell/table dimensions, etc.), document/file type (e.g., MS WORD®, HTML, PDF, XML, plain text, delimited text, etc.), document/page layout (e.g., number of columns/rows per page, ability for tables to span multiple pages, location of tables within pages, etc.), presence, location, and/or format of content (e.g., predefined table types, keywords, units of expression, data patterns (such as data format, data type, permitted/excluded data values, etc.)), etc., which may be known or required to be present in a particular location within the table/document, e.g., in the title, header, column(s), etc., as well-known in the art of document processing, and particularly table detection, extraction, and/or analysis.

Assumptions relating to table descriptors (e.g., title, column headers, etc.) and/or data values represented within tables typically include and/or relate to: formatting (e.g., patterns (such as social security number, account number, routing number, phone number, zip code, date of birth, date/time formatting, etc.)), units (e.g., currency, time, date, weight, volume, mass, etc.), expected/accepted/excluded character values/ranges (e.g., alphabetic, numeric, alphanumeric, symbols, etc.), context (e.g., type of information included in the table, which may include a designated “domain(s)” such as medical, financial, legal, mathematical, scientific, etc.), language, and other assumptions as well-known in the art of document processing, and particularly table detection, extraction, and/or analysis.

Additionally, conventional approaches to processing tables often rely on a priori knowledge and/or “ground truth(s)” regarding the nature of the table(s) and/or content therein. For example, conventional approaches may require up front designation of the location of table(s) within the document(s) to be processed (e.g., page number, location within page), table format (e.g., graphical lines, delimiters, amount of space separating values, number of columns, number of rows, etc.), expected values and/or format (e.g., table title, column and/or row header(s), presence of specific values, patterns, etc. (such as keywords) expected to be present in table(s), etc.), location of data of interest (e.g., table location, column and/or row number), etc. and/or other assumptions as well-known in the art of document processing, and particularly table detection, extraction, and/or analysis.

Skilled artisans familiar with table extraction, and/or upon reading the present disclosure, will appreciate the foregoing assumptions primarily address problems with recall. As such, providing a table/tabular data extraction tool exhibiting high recall (e.g., 90% or greater, preferably 95% or greater, and more preferably 99% or greater) when operating on/with a diverse and/or large set of documents and/or document types would provide a benefit to the field of document processing. Accomplishing such a feat using image data as the source of information regarding tables/tabular data detection, extraction, and/or analysis would also represent an improvement to image processing, as there is no currently available tool or technique for accomplishing such high recall from image data representing the large volume and/or diversity of documents/data sets available for modern applications.

Similar efforts, especially those directed to detecting, extracting, and/or classifying complex, diverse tables and/or constituent tabular data, have thus far failed to yield a robust, efficient, automated solution to the unique challenges associated with analyzing different document types to detect tables and/or tabular data, extracting such tables and/or data, and classifying the tables, portions thereof, e.g., columns, and/or data extracted therefrom.

Certain efforts have accomplished limited success. However, such approaches to providing robust table detection, extraction, and/or classification capabilities have exhibited one or more of the following exemplary limitations, among others described in corresponding cited references.

Historical tools for detecting, analyzing, and/or extracting tables and/or tabular data arrangements conventionally take advantage of structure and/or structured information, which is often directly coded/provided in/via the document containing the table/tabular data arrangement. For instance, spreadsheets such as provided in/via OPENOFFICE®, GOOGLE SHEETS®, MS EXCEL®, etc. are data files including inherent structure in the definition of the file itself, e.g., tables, table titles, headers, descriptors, sections, rows/columns, data values, etc. are all encoded directly in the file, including the defining structure of the table and corresponding data.

Similar, simpler examples of such structured data files including/enabling tabular data arrangements and corresponding structure in the definition of the file itself include extensive markup language (.XML) files, hypertext markup language (.HTML) files, delimited text files (especially tab-delimited and/or comma-delimited text or “comma separated value (.CSV)” files), and any other suitable example of structured data files regarding tables and/or tabular data arrangements, as would be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art upon reading the present disclosure.

Reliance on such structured data, however, limits the scope of input from which tables and/or tabular data may be detected, extracted, and analyzed to those having a predefined structure, which is not the case for many documents (especially physical documents) and image data, generally. For instance, Tengli, et al. (“Learning Table Extraction from Examples” in Proc. 20th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, p. 987 (2004)) and W. Gatterbauer, et al. (“Table Extraction Using Spatial Reasoning on the CSS2 Visual Box Model.” In Proc. 21st National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, p. 1313 (2006)) present techniques for table detection and extraction, but which rely heavily on structure and conventions regarding, and thus are limited to, processing HTML documents/data.

Moreover, in traditional approaches, user-defined search criteria, such as key words, are commonly used to locate and distinguish tables. Such techniques are limited to seeking a given value within a table having known values and/or characteristics (e.g., formatting, structure, etc.). However, such approaches require a priori knowledge of the content of the table/tabular data arrangement, and fail to take advantage of additional information (particularly regarding structure) available by analyzing image characteristics, especially graphical lines, for purposes of table detection and extraction.

In still more conventional/historical approaches, a user specifies column and/or row indices, and an automated system evaluates those portions of the pages/table(s) fully or partially located within the predefined, user-specified column/row index locations. Such techniques are accurate, but inflexible, and characterized by poor recall when working with diverse data sets, and/or where location(s) of data values (or even simply data type(s), e.g., columns) are not known a priori.

For instance: consider two tables similarly describing, among other data, gross earnings (v1) and expenses (v2) respectively for different companies A and B. In Table 1, for Company A, these values are respectively present in the first and fourth rows of the third column, i.e., T1(r1,c3)=v1; T1(r4,c3)=v2. In Table 2, for company B, values v1 and v2 are respectively present in the first row of the second column, and the fifth row of the fifth column (i.e., T2(r1,c2)=v1; T2(r5c5)=v2), e.g., as shown below.

TABLE 1Company Ac1c2c3c4c5r1v1r2r3r4v2r5

TABLE 2Company Bc1c2c3c4c5r1v1r2r3r4r5v2

Despite the presence of common values in both tables, searching for such a match using column or other location indices for either table would not reveal a match in the corresponding location of the other table. In this way, searching by location index often fails to identify the existence of similarity between tables, resulting in poor/misinformative recall, and/or poor overall detection, processing, and extraction of tabular data and arrangements thereof.

Other common challenges with traditional table detection, extraction, and/or analysis of tabular data arrangements include processing source data to accurately identify content and any structure included in the document, (for images, also ensuring adequate image quality), addressing diversity of possible structure(s), presence of empty cells, margins, borders, or other gaps in the tables, etc., density of content, formatting of data values, separation of tables (e.g., across multiple pages and/or files), etc. such as described by Kurama, et al. (“Table Detection, Information, Extraction and Structuring using Deep Learning,” Nanonets (March 2021)).

Clearly, historic, keyword-based, index-based detection, extraction, and analysis of tables and/or tabular data are not a suitable approach for robust, automated detection of diverse table(s) and/or constituent data. Several approaches to overcome these limitations are described below.

Certain entities, e.g., NANONETS® have investigated deep learning techniques employing neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc. to analyze very large sets of curated training examples and corresponding ground truths. However, analyzing and using such large datasets is prohibitive for practical applications, since the devices used to attempt table/tabular data arrangement detection and extraction have only limited resources. Moreover, ground truths for such large sets of training data are not typically available across diverse contexts/applications to which tables and tabular data arrangements are commonly employed in documents and image data. Further still, even modern approaches such as developed by Nanonets require extensive human annotation and/or curation for reliable, robust table detection, extraction, and analysis, for example in order to: track predictions which are correct, and predictions that are incorrect, make corrections to incorrect predictions, trim/remove incorrect predictions, supplement missing data/conclusions, and filter images, among other tasks.

Accordingly, despite a long-felt need, and attempts by the present Applicant and others, none have thus far succeeded in providing systems, methods, and computer program products for detecting, extracting, and/or classifying complex, diverse tables and/or constituent tabular data within documents, especially large, complex documents, and where the documents are provided/analyzed in the form of image data.

It would therefore be of practical benefit to implement systems, techniques, and computer program products generally configured to detect, extract, and classify tables and/or tabular data within documents, especially where tables/data are large, complex, and/or span multiple pages, such as medical charts, financial reports, explanation of benefits (EOB) documents, leases, asset tracking documents, shipping manifests, quality control/assurance tracking, etc. as would be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art upon reading the present disclosure.

Further benefits will be realized by providing systems, techniques, and computer program products capable of detecting, extracting, and/or classifying tables/tabular data without relying on assumptions regarding the table(s) and/or documents, a priori knowledge regarding the table(s) and/or documents (especially regarding structure, format, content, etc. of table(s) and/or document(s)), and user guidance to direct the detection/extraction/classification process.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

According to one embodiment, a computer-implemented method for detecting and classifying tables and/or tabular data arrangements within an original image includes: pre-processing the original image to generate processed image data; detecting one or more tables and/or one or more tabular data arrangements within the processed image data; extracting the one or more tables and/or the one or more tabular data arrangements from the processed image data; and classifying either: the one or more extracted tables; portions of the one or more extracted tables; the one or more extracted tabular data arrangements; portions of the one or more extracted tabular data arrangements; or a combination of: the one or more extracted tables; the portions of the one or more extracted tables; the one or more extracted tabular data arrangements; and/or the portions of the one or more extracted tabular data arrangements.

According to another embodiment, a computer-implemented method for classifying one or more tables and/or one or more tabular data arrangements depicted in image data includes: training a machine learning model, using a training dataset representing a plurality of different tables and/or tabular data arrangements, based at least in part on a plurality of recognized textual elements within the training dataset; and outputting a trained classification model based on the training, wherein the trained classification model is configured to classify one or more tables and/or one or more tabular data arrangements represented within a test dataset according to: one or more table classifications; one or more tabular data arrangement classifications; and/or one or more column classifications; and classifying the one or more tables and/or the one or more tabular data arrangements represented within the test dataset using the trained classification model.

11879231	"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates generally to self-propelled work vehicles, and more particularly to systems and methods for selective automation of vehicle movements and/or work attachment movements during specified portions of loading operations.

BACKGROUND

Self-propelled work vehicles as discussed herein may particularly refer to wheel loaders for illustrative purposes, but may also for example include excavator machines, forestry machines, and other equipment which modify the terrain or equivalent working environment in some way. These work vehicles may have tracked or wheeled ground engaging units supporting the undercarriage from the ground surface, and may further include one or more work attachments which are used to carry material from one location for discharging into a loading area such as for example associated with a truck or hopper.

One of skill in the art will appreciate the persistent challenge in finding experienced operators for certain conventional self-propelled work vehicles. With respect to wheel loaders as exemplary such work vehicles, one particularly challenging portion of the operating cycle for novice operators is that of approaching and loading a loading area such as for example associated with a truck or hopper. Novice operators may typically learn the ‘dig’ portion of the operating cycle relatively quickly but will often continue for some time to be hesitant when approaching a truck or hopper.

As one example, an operation for discharging bulk material from the attachment (e.g., bucket) of the work vehicle may include pivoting movements of the attachment relative to the main frame of the work vehicle and to the loading area, and further includes movement of the work vehicle itself relative to the ground and to the loading area. Accordingly, care must be taken that the attachment and/or other portions of the work vehicle do not collide with the loading area during the discharging operation, which may include not only an approach by the attachment to the loading area but also a withdrawal of the attachment after the discharge of bulk material is complete.

In addition, the work vehicle operator often cannot accurately estimate an appropriate weight of bulk material for a specific loading area (e.g., associated with a transport vehicle) or an appropriate bulk material arrangement/height with respect to the loading area. An excessively high load may for example affect traffic safety, and an excessively low load is economically disadvantageous. Accordingly, it would be desirable if care could further be taken to arrange the discharge of bulk material and/or correct the distribution of bulk material in the loading area to arrive at a maximum load without adverse effects on traffic safety.

BRIEF SUMMARY

The current disclosure provides an enhancement to conventional systems, at least in part by introducing a novel system and method for a selective loading assist feature.

One exemplary objective of such a loading assist feature may be to add value to a customer by automating aspects of a truck loading operation related to controlling attachment (e.g., boom) motion and work vehicle stopping distance with respect to the truck. Referring to a wheel loader application for illustrative purposes, a system and method as disclosed herein may for example use a stereo camera to identify and measure the distance from the wheel loader to a truck or hopper. When an operator triggers the feature, using for example an existing interface tool such as the boom height kick out detent, the feature may automatically engage and subsequently synchronize the motion of the boom and wheels so that the boom arrives at the correct height as the loader reaches the truck.

The system and method as disclosed herein may also limit drivetrain motion so that the loader comes to a smooth stop just at the correct distance to dump in the truck.

Once the approach to the truck has been accomplished other aspects of the dump cycle as further disclosed herein may also be automated for additional value.

Accordingly, a system and method as disclosed herein may provide site owners with increased confidence that even a new operator will not contact the truck bed or hopper with the loader bucket when loading it.

A system and method as disclosed herein may further facilitate the loading operations for novice operators, who may only need to drive up to the truck with the linkage and stopping distance automated for them,

Site owners may further desirably experience a higher and consistent productivity regardless of the experience level of equipment operators.

In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method as disclosed herein is provided for controlled loading by a self-propelled work vehicle comprising a plurality of ground engaging units supporting a main frame, and at least one work attachment moveable with respect to the main frame and configured for loading and unloading material in a loading area external to the work vehicle. One or more location inputs for the loading area detected, via at least one detector associated with the work vehicle, respective to the main frame and/or at least one work attachment. A trigger input is detected in association with transition of the work vehicle from a first work state to an automated second work state. In the second work state, at least movement of the main frame and/or the at least one work attachment is automatically controlled relative to a defined reference associated with the loading area.

In one exemplary aspect according to the above-referenced embodiment, the detecting of one or more location inputs may comprise capturing images via an imaging device and detecting loading area parameters from the captured images.

The detected loading area parameters may further comprise one or more contours of the loading area and any one or more objects corresponding to material currently loaded in the loading area.

The detected loading area parameters may still further comprise a distribution of material currently loaded in the loading area, the method in the second work state further comprising automatically controlling at least movement of the main frame and/or the at least one work attachment to unload material in the loading area in accordance with the detected distribution of material.

In another exemplary aspect according to the above-referenced embodiment, the method may in the second work state further comprise comparing the detected distribution of material to a target loading profile, and based on said comparison selectively controlling at least movement of the main frame and/or the at least one work attachment in a trajectory across a reference plane associated with the loading area.

In another exemplary aspect according to the above-referenced embodiment, the loading area may be associated with a loading vehicle. The target loading profile may further be determined in association with identified locations of the one or more loading vehicle tires and/or loading vehicle axles.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to the fields of spatial information technology, computer graphics, virtual reality technology, and computer operating system, and in particular to a method and an apparatus for processing data.

BACKGROUND

Macro and micro are concepts that correspond to each other and are usually expressed in term of scale. The scale of data includes an intrinsic scale which is objectively existed and a non-intrinsic scale which is subjectively set. For example, geographic research on micro and macro of an object is based on a geographic intrinsic space-time scale, and geographic research on micro and macro of visual field is based on a geographic non-intrinsic space-time scale. In GIS, spatial data reflects intrinsic macro and micro which are objectively existed, and display of an electronic map and spatial analysis and calculation reflect non-intrinsic macro and micro which are subjectively set. With a method in the conventional technology, the problem of unification between the objectively existing intrinsic scale and the subjectively set non-intrinsic scale, in terms of data organization, storage, indexing, and analysis and spatial relationship calculation cannot be solved. For example, the problem of opposition and unity between a map and data, between a map and a coordinate point of data, and even between a map and a data bit of an coordinate point cannot be solved with the method in the conventional technology, since it is required different data, a different coordinate point of the data, and a different data bit of the coordinate point for a map with a different scale. In order to solve the pressure caused by massive spatial data on server, transmission and display, it has pre-process the spatial data by a server, to render into a map image in a specific thematic style. Then the map is cut into different levels of raster images based on a grid having a pyramid structure. A slice at each level is encoded, to determine a unique index value of the slice. When the client browses spatial data by zooming in and out, the client can directly calculate an index value of a slice based on coordinates within the current display range and according to a slice index standard, and send the calculated index value of the slice to the server, then the server transmits slice data corresponding to the index value to the client for displaying. In this way, although partial unification between the objectively existing intrinsic scale and the subjectively set non-intrinsic scale is solved during map display, and the performance bottleneck of the map display is solved, other functions of the system cannot be realized, but resulting in more and new bottlenecks.

Resolution refers to an ability of a measurement or display system to identify details. A definition on resolution approved and issued by the China National Committee for Terms in Sciences and Technologies is that the ability to identify details of a physical quantity.

With the progress of science and technology, as well as the rapid development and wide application of space technology, application fields based on spatial entities, such as computer graphics, virtual reality, urban planning, restoration of cultural relics, animation games, computer-aided design, geographic information system, and medical graphics, has developed rapidly, and data is exploding. The compression, transmission, display, and analysis of massive data have become the main technical bottlenecks restricting the development of these industries.

From the perspective of data display on a screen, the scale of the screen and the scale of the pixels are limited. When data is displayed on pixels of an electronic screen, the number of pixels that can be seen is limited, and each of pixels can only display a piece of data at a certain time. That is to say, the maximum amount of data that can be displayed on a screen is constant, which is irrelevant to how infinite the data is but only related to the resolution of the screen.(1) With regard to drawing, it is only to draw the data that can be finally seen, solving the contradiction between display efficiency and the amount of data.(2) With regard to transmission, it is only to transmit the data to a front terminal via a network, solving the contradiction between network bandwidth and the amount of data.(3) With regard to reading, it is only to read these data, and these data are centrally stored in a file, solving the pressure of disk reading.(4) With regard to query, the key for only reading these data is to only find these data with an index, and the query and retrieval is performed by the client oneself requesting data based on the index. The data is stored in a distributed mode at a server based on an index item of the index, and the client retrieves a data block in a data file to be read with the index, without causing pressure on the server in querying data. In addition, the data amount of indexes should be small enough and cannot increase proportionally with the amount of data. If the data amount of the indexes increases to a certain amount, network transmission of the indexes is a bottleneck.

All problems can be unified into an index problem. If the index problem is solved, other bottleneck problems are solved. The problem to be solved by an index is that, how to have all advantages of a slice index, and data is separated based on a spatial relationship so as to be stored in a distributed mode, rather than splitting data and then storing the data in a distributed mode. With the index, the unification of simplicity and complexity is realized. That is, the organization, management, storage, query, transmission, display and analysis of arbitrarily complex spatial data can be realized with a simple index relationship.

With the index, the non-intrinsic scale and the intrinsic scale are unified, the performance problems when a user views part data and whole data, macro data and micro data at different scales (non-intrinsic scales), and analyzes and calculates the data at different scales, such as reading, transmission, display, analysis and calculation on data, are solved. The contradiction between finite and infinite is solved, that is, the intrinsic scale of data is in harmony with the subjective set non-intrinsic scale. The unification of the subjectively set non-intrinsic scale and the intrinsic scale of the data can be reflected by data in a macro data set, and also by data in a data bit which is a smallest unit to constitute data.

With the index, the unification of simplicity and complexity of the spatial relationship between the data is realized based on the scale, and the problems of function (the problem of whether the function can be realized,) and performance of storage, reading, and analysis and calculation of data are solved, where the problem of function refers to whether a function can be realized, for example, realization of separating data to store, instead of splitting data to store in the conventional technology. The spatial relationship between data at different scales is simple or complex. For example, the spatial relationship between data at a large scale is simple and is only required to consider coincidence or non-coincidence, and then it is determined which data is placed in an index item of the index, to establish a sub-index for management; while the spatial relationship between data at a small scale presents a complex spatial relationship such as an inclusion relationship, an intersection relationship, and a tangency relationship, and the data may be placed in an data item of the index so as to be managed directly without establishing a sub-index. Different data items in the index, serving as data blocks for data management and data records and files for database management, are stored in various storage devices such as a memory and a hard disk.

With the index, data at different scales are unified for query, management, storage, analysis and calculation, based on the scale. All forms of data, such as a macro data set, data describing an object (such as surface data), coordinate data (such as coordinate points constituting surface data), and a micro data bit (such as data on each bit constituting the coordinate data), are unified for management, analysis and calculation, based on different scales in the index.

11900040	"BACKGROUND

In advanced semiconductor technologies, the continuing reduction in device size and increasingly complex circuit arrangements have made the design and fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs) more challenging and costly. To pursue better device performance with smaller footprint and lower power consumption, advanced lithography technologies, e.g., extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, have been investigated as approaches to manufacturing semiconductor devices with a line width of 30 nm or less. EUV lithography employs a mask to control the irradiation of a substrate under EUV radiation so as to form a pattern on the substrate.

While existing lithography techniques have improved, they still fail to meet requirements in many aspects. For example, the quality of radiation beams used in EUV lithography and controlled via the mask needs to be improved.

This disclosure relates to displaying ultrasound images. In particular, it relates to systems and methods for adapting the display of an ultrasound image to the size of an application window displayed on a screen.

BACKGROUND

Ultrasound is a useful, non-invasive imaging technique capable of producing real time images of internal structures within tissue. Ultrasound imaging has an advantage over X-ray imaging in that ultrasound imaging does not involve ionizing radiation.

Some mobile ultrasound scanners such as app-based ultrasound scanners require an add-on device with a screen that may act as both as a display and a control device. Examples of these add-on devices are mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and/or desktop computers. The screen size on these add-on devices can vary greatly. For example, the screen can sometimes be small (e.g., on a smartphone), which means that the displayed ultrasound image is correspondingly small and potentially difficult to read. On the other hand, the screen size can also be relatively large (e.g., on a tablet), such that if the ultrasound image is made to fit the larger screen, the ultrasound image may appear pixelated and also potentially difficult to read.

There is therefore a need for a way to display an ultrasound image that is suited to the size of the screen, and more particularly to the size of an application window displayed on the screen, such that the user does not need to manually scale the ultrasound image.

The above background information is provided to reveal information believed by the applicant to be of possible relevance to the present invention. No admission is necessarily intended, nor should be construed, that any of the preceding information constitutes prior art against the present invention. The embodiments discussed herein may address and/or ameliorate one or more of the aforementioned drawbacks identified above. The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related thereto are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon a reading of the specification and a study of the drawings herein.

The present invention relates in general to a system and a device, and more particularly to a radio frequency (RF) system and a communication device.

BACKGROUND

Wireless communication technology is now widely used in a wide variety of consumer electronic products (for example, a communication device such as mobile phone, tablet computer, laptop, etc.) to receive or transmit various wireless signals. In this regard, an antenna and a communication module (e.g., an IC package with RF devices) are often necessary for wireless communication, so that the antenna can transmit and receive signals from the communication module. For a wireless communication in millimeter wave bands, it is desired for a shorter interconnection between the antenna and the communication module. To obtain a better antenna performance, a thick build-up layer is usually required. However, a thick build-up layer may not be applicable to the current trend in a communication device, which pursues a thin build-up layer with dense interconnections that may suits for various communication devices with flexibility.

This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2022-0074034, filed on Jun. 17, 2022, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The following disclosure relates to a safety ignition device applied to a dual pulse motor.

BACKGROUND

A dual pulse motor using a solid propellant is a rocket propulsion engine in which two propellant grains are separated by a thin diaphragm in one combustion tube.

Generally, combustion of a primary pulse propellant, among the two propellants, allows a rocket to fly toward a target. A secondary pulse propellant, which is burned after a certain period of time, further accelerates the rocket.

The dual-pulse motor has excellent space utilization compared to the use of a separate two-stage rocket. In addition, since the dual pulse motor uses a single combustion tube and a nozzle, manufacturing costs may be reduced.

However, in terms of an ignition device for igniting a propellant, the dual-pulse motor has difficulties in terms of space design. This is because igniters for igniting two pulse motors are separately installed in a single ignition device.

In general, the ignition device is assembled in front of a rocket propulsion engine of the separated two-stage rocket. Since the ignition device utilizes empty space (port) formed in front of each combustion tube, there is no difficulty in designing, manufacturing, and assembling.

However, the dual-pulse motor has difficulties in terms of space design. This is because the dual-pulse motor requires that the ignition device for the primary pulse propellant and the secondary pulse propellant be connected to a single housing and installed in an empty space (port) formed in front of the combustion tube.

Also, since the secondary pulse propellant in the dual pulse motor is located in front of the combustion tube and surrounded by a diaphragm to separate the secondary pulse propellant from the primary pulse propellant, it is more difficult to secure installation space.

Therefore, in the related art, an igniter for the secondary pulse propellant is installed inside the housing of the ignition device assembled in a front port of the propulsion engine. It is designed to form a flow path between the ignition device and the secondary pulse propellant to supply combustion gas from the igniter to the secondary pulse propellant.

In particular, when the primary pulse propellant is significantly separated from the front of the dual pulse motor, it may be difficult for energy generated by the igniter, for the primary pulse propellant, to reach the primary pulse propellant.

In addition, after the primary pulse propellant operates, the second pulse propellant burns after the lapse of a certain period of time. Here, an igniter housing for the first pulse propellant is exposed to flow and heat caused by the combustion gas of the second propellant, so there is a risk of rupture. The ruptured igniter housing for the primary pulse propellant may scatter and adversely affect a nozzle heat-resistant material.

In the related art, in order to solve the problem, the igniter housing for the primary pulse propellant is designed with aluminum or an aluminum alloy so that the igniter housing melts during combustion of the primary pulse propellant. However, when the primary pulse propellant and the primary pulse igniter are separated from each other, it may not be easy to melt the igniter housing and it may be difficult to melt the igniter housing uniformly.

In addition, in the related art, the igniter for the primary pulse propellant and an initiator are connected through a flow path. At this time, when a distance between the primary pulse propellant and the front of the dual pulse motor is large, the flow path should be lengthened and it may be difficult to initiate the igniter for the primary pulse propellant through the initiator.

The dual pulse motor has a small space for the ignition device. For dual pulse motors, it is very difficult to apply an ignition safety device for preventing accidental ignition together with a single ignition device.

In the related art, in order to solve this problem, only an initiator was installed in the ignition device of the dual pulse motor and an ignition safety device was installed in a separate space. Also, the ignition safety device and the initiator were connected using an explosive transfer line.

Due to the above problems, in the related art, the ignition safety device was not installed in front of the combustion tube in the dual pulse motor, and only the initiator, which is part of the ignition safety device, was installed. The ignition safety device was installed elsewhere, and the ignition safety device and initiator were connected by an explosive transfer line.

Therefore, it is necessary to design a safety ignition device that may solve the above problems.

11978720	"BACKGROUND

Integrated circuits are formed on semiconductor wafers, which are then sawed into semiconductor chips. The semiconductor chips may be bonded onto package substrates. During the bonding process, the solder bumps between the semiconductor chips and the package substrates are reflowed. Conventional reflow methods include convection-type reflow or thermal compressive reflow. The convection-type reflow has relatively high throughput since multiple package substrates and the overlying dies may be bonded through the reflow at the same time. However, the convection-type reflow requires a long period of time to heat solder bumps. The resulting high thermal budget may cause significant warpage in the dies, and may possibly cause delamination between low-k dielectric layers in the dies.

The thermal compressive reflow requires a lower thermal budget than the convection-type reflow. In conventional thermal compressive bonding processes, a die is stacked on a package substrate, with the solder bumps on a surface of the die, being pressed against the solder bumps on the surface of the package substrate. After melting the solder bumps, solder bumps cool down to solidify.

The present invention relates to methods for reducing the incidence of mortality in infants undergoing medical treatment.

BACKGROUND

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease (CLD) of pre-term neonates, attributable to lung immaturity with associated surfactant deficiency, systemic inflammation, and the adverse effects of ventilator and supplemental oxygen therapy for acute respiratory problems. BPD is defined clinically as the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) (±3 days). There are an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 pre-term neonates diagnosed with BPD in the United States (US) each year. The risk of developing BPD is related to the degree of prematurity, with the highest risk of BPD occurring in pre-term neonates born prior to 26 weeks gestation and ≤750 g body weight at birth. Pre-term neonates who develop BPD may consequently need long-term breathing support, such as with the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machines or ventilators. Prediction of which pre-term neonates are considered to be at risk of developing BPD can be done by standard methods, e.g., as described in Laughon et al., (2011) Am J Respir Crit Care Med 183:1715-1722.

BPD can develop for several reasons. Pre-term neonates—especially those who develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)—frequently require supplemental oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube). Preterm neonates with RDS require mechanical ventilation, but over-ventilation of this patient population often results in BPD, due to injury to the lungs. See Northway et al., (1967) New Engl J Med 276:357-368. Infections that occur before or shortly after birth also can contribute to BPD. Lack of lung maturation can also affect a pre-term neonate's chance of developing BPD. Pre-term neonates as young as 22 weeks gestational age are surviving, but generally exhibit immature lungs, with large and simplified alveoli with dysmorphic capillaries, negligible airway epithelial lesions, and mild interstitial fibroproliferation. The younger the pre-term neonate, the less-developed are his or her lungs, leaving him or her more likely to develop BPD.

Pre-term neonates with BPD are at greater risk for poor developmental outcomes, acute and chronic lung disease, an increased susceptibility to infections, and more frequent hospitalization for respiratory illness during the first year of life. Antenatal infections, such as chorioamnionitis and acquired pneumonias, are additional potentially complicating and contributing factors in the development of BPD. Late clinical sequelae of BPD result in recurrent respiratory hospitalizations (50% in the first year) and frequent emergency room visits, pulmonary hypertension, late asthma and structural airway disease, exercise intolerance, apnea, sudden death, systemic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, growth failure, feeding difficulties, and developmental delays.

Currently, there are no approved medicinal products in the US or globally to prevent the development of BPD in pre-term neonates. Following FDA approval of inhaled nitric oxide (a potent and selective pulmonary vasodilator) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension secondary to hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) in the term/near term neonate, it has been suggested that inhaled nitric oxide might also benefit the sick pre-term neonate and, in particular, reduce the incidence and/or severity of BPD. Radiographic evidence suggests prolonged inhaled nitric oxide therapy improves lung vascular growth after VEGF inhibition and improves alveolarization in experimental BPD in preterm lambs. The potential therapeutic targets for the use of inhaled nitric oxide in the pre-term neonate include: improved gas exchange and reduced FiO2, lower pulmonary artery pressure, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, sustained surfactant production, and preservation or stimulation of angiogenesis and alveolarization in the developing lung.

Several studies have been directed to use of inhaled nitric oxide to prevent (reduce the incidence of) BPD.

Kinsella et al., (1999) Lancet 354:1061-1065, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in 80 pre-term neonates that was terminated early for enrollment issues. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered at a dose of 5 ppm for 7 days. The results of this study demonstrated a 15.4% reduction in death or BPD (77% inhaled nitric oxide vs 91% placebo; p=0.14), with no increase in severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH).

Schreiber et al., N Engl J Med (2003) 349:2099-2107, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study in 207 pre-term neonates administered a starting dose of inhaled nitric oxide 10 ppm for 1 day, then 5 ppm for 6 days. The results of the Schreiber study demonstrated a 24% reduction in CLD/death (48.6% inhaled nitric oxide vs 63.7% placebo; p=0.03), a 47% reduction in severe IVH/PVL (PVL=periventricular leukomalacia) (12.4% inhaled nitric oxide vs 23.5% placebo; p=0.04), and a 47% reduction in “abnormal or delayed” development (p=0.01).

Van Meurs et al., Pediatrics (2004) 113:559-564, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in 420 (800 planned) pre-term neonates. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered at a starting dose of 5 ppm and increased to 10 ppm if no response (Mean 3 days therapy). The study was stopped prematurely. The results of this study showed overall no difference vs placebo in death or BPD and no difference in IVH.

Kinsella et al., N Engl J Med (2006) 355:354-364, designated the “INOT 25” study, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in 793 subjects. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered at a dose of 5 ppm while the patient was intubated, with a median treatment duration of 14 days. The results of the INOT 25 study showed overall no difference vs placebo in CLD or death (71.6% vs 75.3%) and a 27% reduction in IVH/PVL (17.5% vs 23.9%).

Mercier et al., Lancet (2010) 376:346-54, designated the “INOT 27” study, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in 35 centers in nine European Union countries (800 subjects). Inhaled nitric oxide was administered at a dose of 5 ppm for 7-21 days (treatment duration Mean 16.3 days). The results of the INOT 27 study showed overall no difference in survival without BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (placebo 65.5% vs inhaled nitric oxide 65% (p=0.73)).

Ballard et al., N Engl J Med (2007) 357:1444-1445, and Ballard et al., N Engl J Med (2006) 355:343-353, report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in which 537 pre-term neonates received either inhaled nitric oxide or placebo. Therapy was initiated between Day 7 and Day 21. Patients were administered inhaled nitric oxide 20 ppm for 2 to 4 days, then stepped-down in weekly intervals. All patients were treated for 24 days. The results of this study showed a 20% improvement in survival without CLD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age with inhaled nitric oxide (inhaled nitric oxide 43.9% vs placebo 36.8%, p=0.042). Patients were discharged (p=0.04) or off all ventilator support sooner on study drug (40 weeks, inhaled nitric oxide 65% vs placebo 53%, p=0.01; 44 weeks, inhaled nitric oxide 82% vs placebo 76%, p=0.03).

SUMMARY

It has now been discovered that a particular subset of patients is at an increased risk of mortality when treated with inhaled nitric oxide, and that this subset is defined in part by one or more of race, gender, and gestational age, and also by determination of risk of developing BPD. The affected subset of patients is white, male, pre-term neonates; more specifically, white, male, pre-term neonates less than 27 weeks gestational age; and even more specifically, white, male, pre-term neonates less than 27 weeks gestational age that are at risk of developing BPD. The same risk was not observed in pre-term neonates (male or female) of other races, specifically American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, black, and Hispanic pre-term neonates, nor in female pre-term neonates of any race (including white), nor in neonates of gestational age greater than 27 weeks. Non-white pre-term neonates as a class and female pre-term neonates as a class, even those of gestational age less than 27 weeks, were able to safely receive inhaled nitric oxide administered as a means to prevent development of BPD. The newly discovered risk can be described as follows: in white males<27 weeks gestational age, inhaled nitric oxide may have an increased risk of death as compared to other subgroups. Another way to describe the risk is: in white male pre-term infants<27 weeks gestational age, without pulmonary hypertension and at risk of developing BPD, inhaled nitric oxide may have an increased risk of death as compared to other subgroups. There was seen in one study an imbalance in deaths in this subgroup when treated with nitric oxide as compared to placebo at doses of 20 ppm for 3 days reduced to 10 ppm for 10 days and 5 ppm for remainder of 24 days. This was not seen in other subgroups.

In one aspect, the invention is directed to a method of treatment that includes identifying a plurality of neonates (i.e., two or more) as being candidates for treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (preferably for a reason—such as prevention of BPD—other than treatment of a condition involving pulmonary hypertension); determining that the race of a first neonate of the plurality is black or another non-white race such as American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, or Hispanic; administering inhaled nitric oxide to the first neonate; determining that the race of a second neonate of the plurality is white; determining that the gender of the second neonate is male; determining that the second neonate is of less than 27 weeks gestational age; determining that the fact that the second neonate is a white male of less than 27 weeks gestational age means the second neonate is at a higher risk of mortality upon administration of inhaled nitric oxide compared to a black (or other non-white) male neonate or a female neonate of the same gestational age; and excluding the second neonate from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide, based on the determination that the second neonate has the higher risk of mortality. Thus, neonates who are determined not to have that higher risk of mortality (e.g., because they are non-white, or are female, or are not less than 27 weeks gestational age) are treated with inhaled nitric oxide, while those who have the higher risk of mortality are not treated with inhaled nitric oxide. The reason that the neonates are candidates for treatment with inhaled nitric oxide may be that they are at risk for developing BPD. The reason is preferably not that the neonates have a condition associated with pulmonary hypertension, since such a condition may itself be acutely life-threatening and, in the judgment of the physician, require treatment with inhaled nitric oxide even where the neonate is a white male of less than 27 weeks gestational age. Thus, a further determination that may be made prior to deciding not to treat with inhaled nitric oxide is that the neonate does not have pulmonary hypertension.

In another aspect, the second neonate is identified (e.g., diagnosed) as being at risk of incurring BPD, e.g., from damage attributable to supplemental oxygen therapy that is frequently given to pre-term neonates. Such a neonate may be excluded from treatment of inhaled nitric oxide at a dosing regimen typically used to prevent BPD because of the mortality risk specific to white, male, pre-term neonates of less than 27 weeks gestational age.

Administration of inhaled nitric oxide to pre-term neonates who are candidates for inhaled nitric oxide therapy because they have been identified as being at risk for developing BPD typically begins no less than five days after birth, due at least in part to risk of brain hemorrhage. Treatment of these pre-term neonates may begin at a point during the period that is 5 to 14 days after birth, 5 to 10 days after birth, 5 to 21 days after birth, 7 to 21 days after birth, or 5 to 7 days after birth. Administration of inhaled nitric oxide for the purpose of preventing BPD in susceptible pre-term neonates generally continues for 20-30 days after it is initiated. In specific treatment protocols, administration of inhaled nitric oxide may be continued for at least 18 days, 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, 22 days, 23 days, 24 days, 25 days, 26 days, 27 days, 28 days, 29 days or 30 days, and may involve a stepwise decrease in nitric oxide concentration (e.g., in two, three, or four steps) over that time period. Treatments requiring inhaled nitric oxide for prevention or treatment of a different disorder or underlying condition may have a different dosing regimen.

The second neonate may have an underlying condition, such as pulmonary hypertension or hypoxic respiratory failure, that may benefit from inhaled nitric oxide treatment at a very different dosing regimen than suggested for prevention of BPD. Thus, in one aspect, a neonate who is male, white, less than 27 weeks gestational age, and at risk of BPD may indeed safely receive inhaled nitric oxide for the underlying condition, but for a limited duration less than that typically utilized to prevent BPD (e.g., a limited duration of approximately one, two, three, four, five, or six hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, three days, or four days). The duration will typically be long enough to relieve, at least temporarily, the underlying condition, but will usually be less than 96 hours (e.g., less than 80 hours, or less than 70 hours, or less than 60 hours. In some embodiments, the treatment will last for a period between approximately 40 hours and 70 hours.

One or more of the neonates may have, or be at risk of incurring, pulmonary hypertension that can be relieved at least in part with inhaled nitric oxide at a specific dosing regimen (timing, duration, amount, and manner of dosing) different from that typically used to prevent BPD. The second neonate may be given an alternate acceptable treatment for his/her underlying condition. The second neonate may also be at risk of mortality due to an underlying condition, such pulmonary hypertension, and may be administered inhaled nitric oxide at a specific dosing regimen that is different (much shorter duration) from the dosing regimen that is used for the prevention of BPD. If the underlying condition is hypoxic respiratory failure, the alternate treatment could be, for example, ventilatory support (e.g., high-frequency oscillatory ventilation) with supplemental oxygen, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), intravenous fluids, surfactant, and/or bicarbonate therapy. In some embodiments, the first and/or second neonate is a potential candidate for inhaled nitric oxide at least in part because he/she is identified as being at risk of BPD. In other embodiments, the first and/or second neonate is a candidate for inhaled nitric oxide because the neonate has a condition that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, or is undergoing, or has just undergone, a procedure that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, such as cardiac surgery involving heart/lung bypass.

In another aspect, the method of treatment includes identifying a plurality of neonates as being candidates for treatment with inhaled nitric oxide; determining that the race of a first neonate of the plurality is black or another non-white race or that the gender of the first neonate is female; administering inhaled nitric oxide to the first neonate; determining that the race of a second neonate of the plurality is white; determining that the gender of the second neonate is male; determining that the fact that the second neonate is a white male means the second neonate is at a higher risk of mortality upon administration of inhaled nitric oxide compared to a nonwhite (e.g., black) or female neonate of the same gestational age; and excluding the second neonate from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide, based on the determination that the second neonate has the higher risk. In some embodiments, the neonate is less than 27 week gestational age and/or is at risk of developing BPD. One or more of the neonates may have, or be at risk of incurring, pulmonary hypertension that can be relieved at least in part with inhaled nitric oxide. The second neonate may be given an alternate acceptable treatment (or inhaled nitric oxide at a specific dosing regimen dissimilar from the dosing regimen that would typically be used to prevent BPD) for his/her underlying condition. If the underlying condition is pulmonary hypertension or hypoxic respiratory failure, the second neonate may be given one or more alternate acceptable treatment(s), such as ventilatory support (e.g., high-frequency oscillatory ventilation) with supplemental oxygen, ECMO, intravenous fluids, surfactant, and/or bicarbonate therapy, instead of inhaled nitric oxide. In other embodiments, the second neonate is a candidate for inhaled nitric oxide at a specific dosing regimen different than the dosing regimen administered to the first neonate for prevention of BPD because he has a condition that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, or is undergoing, or has just undergone, a procedure that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, such as cardiac surgery involving heart/lung bypass. In this instance, the dosing regimen of inhaled nitric oxide received by the second neonate is for a shorter duration than would typically be used to prevent BPD.

In another aspect, the method of treatment includes performing at least one diagnostic process (which may include performing echocardiography) to identify a plurality of neonates who have an underlying condition, such as hypoxic respiratory failure or being at risk of BPD, that makes them candidates for inhaled nitric oxide treatment; determining that the race of a first neonate of the plurality is black (or another non-white race) or the gender is female; administering inhaled nitric oxide to the first neonate; determining that a second neonate of the plurality is a white male of less than 27 weeks gestational age; determining that the fact that the second neonate is a white male of less than 27 weeks gestational age means the second neonate is at a higher risk of mortality upon administration of inhaled nitric oxide compared to a black or female neonate patient of the same gestational age; and either providing an alternative treatment to the second neonate or administering inhaled nitric oxide at a shorter duration than what would typically be used for prevention of BPD. Such duration for the second neonate may be less than 1 day, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, or 4 days, or an increment of hours that is less than 96 hours, e.g., 6 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 40 hours, 48 hours, 50 hours, 60 hours, 72 hours, or 84 hours. The second neonate may be given an alternate acceptable treatment for his underlying condition, such as one or more of ventilatory support (e.g., high-frequency oscillatory ventilation) with supplemental oxygen, ECMO, intravenous fluids, surfactant, and/or bicarbonate therapy, instead of inhaled nitric oxide.

Also within the invention is a method of selecting a treatment for a neonate, the method encompassing performing at least one diagnostic process (which may include echocardiography) to identify a neonate (e.g., a premature infant of less than 27 weeks gestational age who may be at risk of BPD) with pulmonary hypertension and/or hypoxic respiratory failure; determining that the neonate is a white male; determining that the fact that the neonate is a white male means he is at a higher risk of mortality upon administration of inhaled nitric oxide compared to a black or other non-white neonate or a female neonate of the same gestational age when administered inhaled nitric oxide in a fashion consistent with preventing BPD; and either excluding the white male neonate from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide or treating the white male neonate with inhaled nitric oxide at a dosing regimen of a significantly shorter duration than the 20-30 days that would typically be used for preventing BPD in pre-term neonates susceptible to BPD, based on the determination that the white male neonate is at a higher risk of mortality than a black neonate or female neonate of the same gestational age if treated with a dosing regimen suitable for preventing BPD. Alternatives to treatment with inhaled nitric oxide for treating or preventing hypoxic respiratory failure or pulmonary hypertension may include one or more of ventilatory support (e.g., with supplemental oxygen), ECMO, intravenous fluids, surfactant, and/or bicarbonate therapy or other acceptable treatment. The ventilatory support may involve high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. In some embodiments, the white male neonate is considered to be at risk of BPD. In other embodiments, the neonate is a candidate for inhaled nitric oxide because he has a condition that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, or is undergoing, or has just undergone, a procedure that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, such as cardiac surgery involving heart/lung bypass.

Also within the invention is a method of selecting a treatment for a pre-term neonate, the method encompassing identifying a pre-term neonate of less than 27 weeks gestational age; treating the pre-term neonate with mechanical ventilation or positive airway pressure support; determining that the pre-term neonate is at risk of BPD; determining that the pre-term neonate is a white male; determining that the fact that the pre-term neonate is a white male means the pre-term neonate is at a higher risk of mortality upon administration of inhaled nitric oxide for prevention of BPD compared to a black or other non-white pre-term neonate or a female pre-term neonate of the same gestational age; and, based on the determination of higher risk, excluding the white, male, pre-term neonate from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide for prevention of BPD. The white, male, pre-term neonate may be treated with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation instead of inhaled nitric oxide.

In another aspect, the method of treatment includes identifying a pre-term neonate of less than 27 weeks gestational age as being in need of treatment for prevention of BPD; determining that the race of the pre-term neonate is white and the gender is male; determining that the fact that the pre-term neonate is a white male means the pre-term neonate is at a higher risk of mortality upon administration of inhaled nitric oxide compared to a black or other non-white pre-term neonate or a female pre-term neonate of the same gestational age; deciding to postpone inhaled nitric oxide treatment until the white, male, pre-term neonate reaches 27 weeks postmenstrual age; administering a treatment other than inhaled nitric oxide to the white, male, pre-term neonate; and, when the white, male, pre-term neonate reaches 27 weeks postmenstrual age, beginning administration of inhaled nitric oxide to the white, male, pre-term neonate, where the decision to postpone inhaled nitric oxide treatment until 27 weeks postmenstrual age is based on the higher risk of mortality in white, male, pre-term neonates of less than 27 weeks postmenstrual age. The nitric oxide will typically be administered initially at 20 ppm, and may be decreased gradually to 10 ppm, then 5 ppm, and finally 2 ppm over the course of treatment. The treatment administered prior to beginning inhaled nitric oxide administration may be, for example, ventilatory support (e.g., with supplemental oxygen).

In another aspect, the method of treatment includes identifying a pre-term neonate of less than 27 weeks gestational age (e.g., less than 26 weeks) as being in need of inhaled nitric oxide for prevention or treatment of a condition involving pulmonary hypertension (e.g., hypoxic respiratory failure); determining that the race of the pre-term neonate is white; determining that the gender of the pre-term neonate is male; determining that the fact that the pre-term neonate is a white male means the pre-term neonate is at a higher risk of mortality upon administration of inhaled nitric oxide compared to a black or other non-white pre-term neonate or a female pre-term neonate of the same gestational age; administering a treatment other than inhaled nitric oxide to the white, male, pre-term neonate; and, when the white, male, pre-term neonate reaches 27 weeks postmenstrual age, beginning administration of inhaled nitric oxide to the white, male, pre-term neonate, where the decision to postpone inhaled nitric oxide treatment until 27 weeks postmenstrual age is because of the higher risk of mortality in white, male, pre-term neonates of less than 27 weeks postmenstrual age. The nitric oxide will typically be administered at 20 ppm. The treatment administered prior to beginning inhaled nitric oxide administration may be, for example, ventilatory support (e.g., with supplemental oxygen), ECMO, intravenous fluids, surfactant, and/or bicarbonate therapy, or another alternative therapy. Such treatment (except ECMO) may optionally be continued during the period that inhaled nitric oxide is administered. The ventilatory support may involve high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. Treatment of any pre-term neonate with ECMO may be possible only if the pre-term neonate's blood vessels are of adequate size. In some embodiments, the white, male, pre-term neonate is considered to be at risk of BPD, in addition to having a condition involving pulmonary hypertension. The pre-term neonate may be a candidate for inhaled nitric oxide because he has a condition that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, or is undergoing, or has just undergone, a procedure that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, such as cardiac surgery involving heart/lung bypass.

In another aspect, the method of treatment includes identifying a pre-term neonate of less than 27 weeks gestational age as being a candidate for treatment with inhaled nitric oxide because of an underlying condition; determining that the race of the pre-term neonate is white and the gender is male; providing ventilatory support to the pre-term neonate; determining that the fact that the pre-term neonate is a white male means the pre-term neonate is at a higher risk of mortality upon administration of inhaled nitric oxide compared to a black or other non-white pre-term neonate or a female pre-term neonate of the same gestational age; and, based on the determination of higher risk, either excluding the white, male, pre-term neonate from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide, or treating the white, male, pre-term neonate with inhaled nitric oxide, but using a treatment regimen shorter than typically used to treat the underlying condition. The ventilatory support may be continued after the pre-term neonate is excluded from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide, or may be substituted with ECMO at that point if the underlying condition involves hypoxia and if ECMO is appropriate for the patient. The ventilatory support may be high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The white, male, pre-term neonate may also be treated with intravenous fluids, surfactant, and/or bicarbonate therapy. In some embodiments, the white, male, pre-term neonate is a candidate for inhaled nitric oxide at least in part because he is identified as being at risk of BPD. In other embodiments, the pre-term neonate is a candidate for inhaled nitric oxide because he has a condition that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, or is undergoing, or has just undergone, a procedure that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, such as cardiac surgery involving heart/lung bypass. Alternatively or in addition, the pre-term neonate may have pulmonary hypertension (e.g., associated with hypoxic respiratory failure) that can be relieved at least in part with inhaled nitric oxide.

In certain embodiments of any of the above methods, the neonates (in particular, the white, male, pre-term neonates) are not dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood, and/or do not have left ventricular dysfunction. The methods may include steps of carrying out standard tests (such as echocardiography) to determine whether the neonates have either or both of those conditions, prior to making a decision about administration of inhaled nitric oxide.

In certain embodiments of the above methods, the non-white neonates and female neonates, and also the white, male neonates who are more than 27 weeks postmenstrual age, who are not excluded from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (because the above-described increased risk of mortality does not apply to them), are treated with inhaled nitric oxide as a means to prevent BPD. This treatment typically begins at least five days after birth of a pre-term (<30 weeks gestational age) neonate, e.g., five to fourteen days after birth, five to ten days after birth, five to seven days after birth, or five to 21 days after birth. A typical protocol for inhaled nitric oxide treatment of a pre-term neonate at risk of BPD involves administering decreasing concentrations of nitric oxide over the course of administration, beginning at 20 ppm. In certain embodiments, the initial dose of 20 ppm nitric oxide is decreased to 10, then 5, and then 2 ppm over the course of administration. In specific embodiments, the administration of nitric oxide is for at least 20 days, preferably at least 24 days, and can be up to 30 days. In a specific example of nitric oxide administration, the initial administration of 20 ppm nitric oxide lasts for a period of 48 to 96 hours, followed by a week at 10 ppm, a week at 5 ppm, and then a week at 2 ppm.

In certain embodiments, an alternative treatment for a pre-term neonate who is at risk of BPD, but who is not treated with inhaled nitric oxide because the pre-term neonate is a white male of less than 27 weeks gestational age, is one or more of any acceptable treatment, including but not limited to caffeine, vitamin A, supplemental oxygen, and one or more surfactants, antenatal steroid, etc. (Any of these alternative treatments (e.g., vitamin A or supplemental oxygen) may also be used in conjunction with inhaled nitric oxide for the prevention of BPD in appropriate patients.)

The invention also includes a system for use in administering inhaled nitric oxide gas. The system reduces the overall risk of mortality from inhalation of nitric oxide by providing instructions for use of nitric oxide that include a warning about a specific risk to a specific population of pre-term neonates. The system also includes a source of pharmaceutically acceptable nitric oxide gas for inhalation and a delivery device suitable for delivering nitric oxide gas from the source to a neonatal patient. The instructions may include, for example, a description of operating the system to deliver 20 ppm inhaled nitric oxide to treat a condition such as one or more of hypoxic respiratory failure or BPD or pulmonary arterial hypertension, a contraindication for neonates who are dependent on right to left shunting of blood, and/or a contraindication or warning regarding patients who have pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction. The instructions also include a warning that inhaled nitric oxide may produce an increased risk of death in white, male, pre-term infants of less than 27 weeks gestational age (and do not include a similar warning for pre-term infants of less than 27 weeks gestational age who are female or are not white). The latter warning may also specify that the white, male, pre-term infants of less than 27 weeks gestational age are ones who are at risk of developing BPD, may say the white, male, pre-term infants do not have pulmonary hypertension, and may be effective in reducing the overall risk of mortality from inhalation of nitric oxide compared to a similar system without the instructions, and may be effective in excluding a population of white, male, pre-term infants less than 27 weeks gestational age from treatment with inhaled nitric oxide, thereby reducing the overall risk of mortality resulting from inhaled nitric oxide treatment. In addition or instead, the instructions may communicate that, in a subset of white, male, pre-term infants less than 27 weeks gestational age, without pulmonary hypertension and at risk of developing BPD, there was seen in one study an imbalance in deaths in the INOmax treated group as compared to placebo, and may specify that the study used doses of 20 ppm for 3 days reduced to 10 ppm for 10 days and 5 ppm for remainder of 24 days.

In other embodiments, the white male neonate who is excluded is less than 30 weeks gestational age, or less than 29 weeks, 28 weeks, 26 weeks, 25 weeks, 24 weeks, or 23 weeks.

Also disclosed is a method of distributing a pharmaceutical product. This method includes supplying a source of nitric oxide or any material that can be converted to nitric oxide to a medical provider responsible for treating a plurality of neonatal patients who are candidates for treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (e.g., neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure and/or pulmonary hypertension, or those at risk of BPD), including pre-term neonates such as those of less than 27 weeks gestational age; informing the medical provider than a recommended dose of inhaled nitric oxide gas is 20 ppm nitric oxide; and providing a warning to the medical provider that the risk of mortality from inhalation of nitric oxide is higher in white, male, pre-term neonates less than 27 weeks gestational age (e.g., those who are at risk of BPD and so might otherwise be treated with inhaled nitric oxide to help prevent BPD) than in non-white pre-term neonates or female pre-term neonates of the same gestational age. In preferred embodiments, the warning is effective to cause a medical provider considering inhaled nitric oxide treatment in a white, male, pre-term neonate less than 27 weeks gestational age (e.g., for prevention of BPD) to forego use of inhaled nitric oxide in that pre-term neonate in order to avoid putting the pre-term neonate at increased risk of mortality, or otherwise to reduce the use of inhaled nitric oxide in such white, male, pre-term neonates, including those at risk of developing BPD. The medical provider may choose to substitute another appropriate treatment. The various instructions and warnings may be supplied to the medical provider in the form of a label attached to and/or shipped with the source of nitric oxide, or in materials otherwise supplied to the medical provider. The medical provider who is so informed may use the source of nitric oxide (or any material that can be converted to nitric oxide gas that is then delivered to and inhaled by a patient) to treat patients who are candidates for treatment with inhaled nitric oxide, including pre-term neonates. Prior to treating a given pre-term neonate, the medical provider may assess whether the pre-term neonate falls within one of the populations described in the instructions as being at increased risk of harm. This assessment includes determining whether the patient is a white, male, pre-term neonate of less than 27 weeks gestational age, and may include determining whether the patient is at risk of BPD. In accordance with the warning regarding that population, the medical provider will likely avoid treating such a patient with inhaled nitric oxide, and may utilize another suitable alternative treatment instead. If the patient is a non-white or a female, the warning does not apply, so the medical provider can treat such a patient with inhaled nitric oxide, even though the latter patient is of less than 27 weeks gestational age and can be characterized as at risk of BPD.

The method of distributing the pharmaceutical product may also include steps of manufacturing the source of nitric oxide gas before it is supplied to the medical provider. If the source of nitric oxide gas is a cylinder of compressed gas, it may be manufactured by a process comprising diluting nitric oxide gas with nitrogen gas to produce a compressed gaseous mixture of nitric oxide and nitrogen in a cylinder. The pharmaceutical product may instead include N2O4(in liquid form) or nitrogen dioxide (in gaseous form); such a product is supplied in a form that is ultimately converted to nitric oxide at the patient's bedside. If the source of nitric oxide gas is a container containing compressed nitric oxide or nitrogen dioxide, the method may further comprise generating the nitric oxide or nitrogen dioxide and introducing it into the container in compressed form, prior to supplying it to the medical provider. By “supplying to the medical provider” is meant causing the source of nitric oxide gas to be delivered to the medical supplier, e.g., by transporting it from one site (such as the manufacturing location or a distributer or storage building) to another site (e.g., where the medical provider administers inhaled nitric oxide treatment to patients).

The disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for streaming video content using adaptive buffers.

BACKGROUND

Users frequently stream media content (e.g., videos, television programs, movies, music, etc.) from media content sharing services to user devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablet computers, smart televisions, media players, etc.). A user device streaming a media content item may buffer the media content item so that a portion of the media content is available for presentation in cases where a network connection used to stream the media content item drops in quality or lags. In many cases, a user device uses a fixed buffer size. In some such cases, a server may transmit portions of a media content item that are stored in the buffer that are not presented, for example, in cases where a user of the user device stops presentation of the media content item before the stored portions are presented. Transmitting portions of a media content item that are buffered but not presented can be a waste of resources, both for the server and the user device.

Accordingly, it is desirable to provide new methods, systems, and media for streaming video content.

SUMMARY

Methods, systems, and media for streaming video content using adaptive buffers are provided. (An “adaptive” buffer provides memory storage having a size (e.g., storage capacity) that may be changed as required, whereas a fixed buffer provides memory storage of a fixed size.)

In accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, a method for streaming video content using buffers is provided, the method comprising: transmitting, from a user device to a server, a request to stream a video content item; receiving, at the user device from the server, a predicted abandonment distribution that indicates a plurality of likelihoods of a user of the user device stopping presentation of the video content item at a corresponding plurality of presentation time points of the video content item; receiving, at the user device from the server, a first portion of the video content item; storing the first portion of the video content item in a buffer of the user device having a first size; causing the video content item to be presented by the user device; determining a second size of the buffer based on the predicted abandonment distribution; modifying a size of the buffer to the second size; requesting a second portion of the video content item from the server based on the second size of the buffer; receiving the second portion of the video content item from the server; and storing the second portion of the video content item in the buffer of the second size while continuing presentation of the video content item. Typically the presentation time points for which the predicted abandonment distribution indicates a respective likelihood of the user of the user device stopping presentation of the video content item include at least one time point that is between the start time point of the content item and the end time point of the content item, and may include multiple different time points that are between the start time point of the content item and the end time point. Additionally, the presentation time points for which the predicted abandonment distribution indicates a respective likelihood of the user of the user device stopping presentation of the video content item may include the end point of the video content item. As a further example, the presentation time points for which the predicted abandonment distribution indicates a respective likelihood of the user of the user device stopping presentation of the video content item may be at point D/n, 2D/n . . . (n−1)D/n, where n is a positive integer and D is the duration of the video content item, and optionally may also include a presentation time point at the end of the video content item.

In some embodiments, determining the second size of the buffer based on the predicted abandonment distribution comprises: determining that a likelihood of the plurality of likelihoods of the user of the user device stopping presentation of the video content item is below a predetermined threshold; and, in response to determining that the likelihood of the plurality of likelihoods is below the predetermined threshold, determining that the second size of the buffer is to be larger than the first size.

In some embodiments, determining the second size of the buffer based on the predicted abandonment distribution comprises: determining that a likelihood of the plurality of likelihoods of the user of the user device stopping presentation of the video content item exceeds a predetermined threshold; and, in response to determining that the likelihood of the plurality of likelihoods exceeds the predetermined threshold, determining that the second size of the buffer is to be smaller than the first size.

In some embodiments, the method further comprises: determining a third size of the buffer based on the predicted abandonment distribution; and modifying the size of the buffer to the third size while continuing presentation of the video content item.

In some embodiments, the predicted abandonment distribution is normalized to a duration of the video content item.

In some embodiments, the predicted abandonment distribution is calculated based on a duration of the video content item.

In some embodiments, the predicted abandonment distribution is calculated based on characteristics of the video content item.

In accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, a system for streaming video content using buffers is provided, the system comprising a hardware processor that is configured to: transmit, from a user device to a server, a request to stream a video content item; receive, at the user device from the server, a predicted abandonment distribution that indicates a plurality of likelihoods of a user of the user device stopping presentation of the video content item at a corresponding plurality of presentation time points of the video content item; receive, at the user device from the server, a first portion of the video content item; store the first portion of the video content item in a buffer of the user device having a first size; cause the video content item to be presented by the user device; determine a second size of the buffer based on the predicted abandonment distribution; modify a size of the buffer to the second size; request a second portion of the video content item from the server based on the second size of the buffer; receive the second portion of the video content item from the server; and store the second portion of the video content item in the buffer of the second size while continuing presentation of the video content item.

In accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, there is provided a computer-readable medium, which may be a non-transitory computer-readable medium although these embodiments are not limited to a non-transitory computer-readable medium.

11863098	"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

The present application is a national stage entry of International (PCT) Patent Application Number PCT/EP2019/074665, filed Sep. 16, 2019, which claims priority to European Patent Application No. 18195287.0, filed Sep. 18, 2018, the subject matter of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to multi-level voltage source PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) inverters and in particular for 3-level inverters which are suitable for driving high speed electrical machines, especially for mobile applications. The invention also relates to a drive including an inverter for controlling an electrical motor.

A multi-level inverter is a power electronic device generating an AC voltage signal output using DC voltage inputs. A two-level inverter is used in many applications to generate an AC voltage from a DC voltage. A two-level Inverter creates two different voltages for the load, for instance if a DC voltage +Vdcis the input, a two-level inverter may provide switched +Vdc2 and −Vdc2 signals of varying pulse width at the output (Phase to star). Although this method of creating AC is simple and effective, one of the drawbacks are the harmonic distortions in the output voltage and also has a high dv/dt as compared to that of higher level inverters.

Three-level and higher level inverters (five, seven, etc) enable the generation of smoother stepped output waveforms with lower dv/dt and also lower harmonic distortions.

In particular, Multi-level (three and higher level) inverters allow an important reduction in inverter induced motor losses without external sinusoidal filters. Especially in mid- and full load, the phase current THD (total harmonic distortion) of a Multi-level inverter is much lower than with a comparable two-level inverter.

A Multi-level inverter requires however additional power switching devices, additional gate control hardware and the need to measure and control two or more DC bus voltages. The control of the different DC bus voltages requires either additional hardware or more complex software for processing different PWM patterns.

Balancing of the neutral point voltage in a three or higher level voltage source inverter by using appropriate PWM patterns is however a complex and challenging task. The required neutral point current to eliminate a possible neutral point potential deviation can be derived from the phase currents polarity information (seeFPGA-based Control of Three-Level Inverters, PCIM EuropeMay 2011, Nuremberg Germany, Jens Onno Krah, Markus Höltgen, Andreas Rath, Rolf Richter [1], and A comprehensiveStudy of Neutral-Point Voltage Balancing Problem in Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Voltage Source PWM Inverters, IEEE Transactions on power electronicsvol 15 no2 March 2000, Nikola Celanovic, Dushan Boroyevich [2]). The methods described in [1] and [2] promise full controllability of the neutral point with some restrictions on power factor cos(ϕ) and output frequency. A critical situation however arises in low frequency and high phase current inverter operation.

InA Novel Neutral Point Potential Stabilization Technique Using the Information of Output Current Polarities and Voltage Vector, IEEE Transactions on industry applications, vol 38, no6, November 2002, Kazsutoshi Yamanaka, Ahmet M. Hava, Hiroshi Kirino, Yoshiyuki Tanaka, Noritaka Koga and Tsuneo Kume [3] andAnalysis of variation of neutral point potential in neutral-point-clamped voltage source PWM inverter, IEEE 0-7803-1462-x/93Okayama University Digital Information Repository, Satoshi Ogasawara, Hirofumi Akagi [4], a technique using the redundant space vectors in a manner to gain control over the neutral point potential even at low frequencies is proposed, although balancing can remain impossible for a non-rotating output (0 Hz). The utilization of the redundant space vectors causes more harmonics in the output current and can lead to undesired common mode effects.

System benefits, such as increased efficiency and reduced EMC, of a three-level system compared to a two-level system is well known as describedin Comparative Evaluation of Advanced Three-Phase Three-Level Inverter/Converter Topologies Against Two-Level Systems, Mario Schweizer, Thomas Friedli, and Johann W. Kolar [5]. These benefits can also result in reduced size of filter components and reduced chip area. The specific problem of neutral point stability is however not addressed in [5].

The term “multi-level” as used herein in relation to the inverter or to the modulation pattern is intended to encompass three-level and higher level, but not two-level, which is referred to as two-level. It may be noted that if there are more than 3 modulation levels, there will be also be more than one neutral point.

An object of the invention is to provide an accurate and economical multi-level inverter with low harmonic distortion yet high neutral point stability.

An object of the invention is to provide a method of controlling a multi-level inverter to achieve low harmonic distortion yet high neutral point stability in an efficient and economical manner.

The present application is the US National Stage of International Patent Application No. PCT/NL2020/050687, filed on Nov. 5, 2020, which in turn, claims priority to Dutch Patent Application No. 2024200, filed on Nov. 8, 2019.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates in general to debugging one or more printed circuit boards.

The present disclosure further relates to an arrangement for, and a debugging arrangement as well as a computer program product for testing printed circuit boards.

BACKGROUND

Printed circuit boards may comprise a large number of electronic components, these components are attached to the printed circuit board for example through contact pads. Conductive tracks connect the components through their conductive pads.

Modern printed circuit boards have multi-layer prints with trace layers or conductive tracks in between the layers. As such, only the tracks on the top and bottom layer of the printed circuit board are visible. Since modern printed circuit boards may comprise between four and eight layers (although many more layers may also be common), most of the tracks are invisible. Testing and debugging such printed circuit boards is thus challenging since many of the pins of the components are difficult to distinguish by the debugger since they are invisible. Many components and tracks are also very small which further complicates testing and debugging.

Failures by one of the components or one of the tracks may already cause the complete printed circuit board to malfunction. It is therefore desirable that each component and every track can be monitored and tested to ensure correct functioning.

To this end, in the design phase of the printed circuit board, boundary-scan functionality may be implemented in the board. With boundary-scan an electronic serial interface is provided which allows access to embedded logic on many of today's electrical components, e.g. integrated circuits. With the boundary-scan components, several functionalities are added to the boards such as, logic testing, for example testing of connections between devices without external test probes, programming logic, for example for programming FPGA's, and for debugging logic in integrated circuits and microcontrollers.

Many of today's printed circuit boards are equipped with boundary-scan devices. These printed circuit boards can be tested by running a boundary-scan test (BST). Boundary Scan Test (BST) is a method developed to assist the testing of Printed Circuit Boards and is laid down in a standard (IEEE Std. 1149.1—1990).

In order to detect faults of the PCB, test patterns or test vectors have to be developed, preferably test vectors or test patterns which cover all faults and yet make a diagnosis as simple as possible. Use of such test vectors in a boundary-scan test is very beneficial for testing the several functional aspects of the printed circuit board and individual components and tracks thereof, and is also adequate for inspecting which components are connected with each other.

Boundary-scan provides a tool in all stages of the PCB. Meaning, that during the design stage, boundary-scan provides the designer of the PCB with a tools for ad-hoc debugging of certain aspects of the PCB, even before the PCB has been released for production. If the design is final, and corresponding test vectors have been developed, the assembled boards may be tested for faults during the production test stage. Later, similarity in the service stage boundary-scan provides a tool for ad-hoc debugging.

In all stages of the PCB, the designer, tester and service engineer may run (ad-hoc) boundary-scan tests to determine if output of the test is as expected. Given thorough designs and manufacturing, most output will be as expected and tests will pass. However, as with all design and manufacturing, sometimes the outcome isn't as expected. In such cases, the designer and/or tester will have to debug and dive into the details of the test to determine where the error is. This can be very challenging.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a simplified and efficient method for debugging a printed circuit board as well as test-patters for printed circuit boards, with one or more boundary-scan compliant devices.

The object is achieved in a first aspect of the present disclosure, by a method of debugging a printed circuit board, and/or at least one test-pattern for such printed circuit board, said printed circuit board comprising a plurality of devices mounted on said printed circuit board having circuit terminals for interconnecting said devices, said devices comprising at least one boundary-scan compliant device having boundary-scan compliant circuit terminals and comprising a boundary-scan register of boundary-scan cells of said boundary-scan compliant circuit terminals, said method using an electronic processing unit and comprising the steps of:retrieving, by said processing unit, boundary-scan properties of said at least one boundary-scan compliant device, said boundary-scan properties at least comprising a listing of boundary-scan compliant circuit terminals of said at least one boundary-scan compliant device;retrieving, by said processing unit, connectivity properties of said plurality of devices mounted on said printed circuit board, said connectivity properties at least comprising a listing of interconnects between said circuit terminals of said devices;displaying, by said processing unit, a circuit graph of at least a part of said devices mounted on said printed circuit board, said circuit graph comprising at least one device of said plurality of devices mounted on said printed circuit board and a least one further device from said plurality of devices which comprises a circuit terminal interconnected to a circuit terminal of said device for visualizing at least said device, said further device and interconnects between said devices for debugging said printed circuit board; wherein said device is determined by receiving, by said processing unit, a selection from one of the group of: said printed circuit board, said devices mounted on said printed circuit board, and a circuit terminal of one of said devices mounted on said printed circuit board.

With boundary-scan a low-cost tool is provided to verify the correctness of the components on a PCB as well as the interconnects between these components. It allows both certain functional aspects as well as structural testing of the components and the nets within the PCB, for components and interconnects which are located on the surface of the board, but even for those in intermediate layers of a multi-layer PCB.

With boundary-scan designers, testers and service engineers are given tools for debugging certain aspects of the PCB. In the design stage it may for example help designers to select boundary-scan compliant devices such that the testing of the PCB can be done in a more efficient manner, i.e. with aid of boundary-scan tests. In the testing stage, the tester may perform a predefined boundary-scan test or test vector to determine if all components and interconnects operate as expected according to the tests.

If a boundary-scan test fails, meaning components and/or interconnects under test indicate fails or the output data of a test is not as expected, debugging may be required for further examination and determine where the error is.

Often, the tester or designer may receive or determine from the output of the boundary-scan test at least some details where the error occurred. For example, the test fails at a certain component or blocks of components on the PCB. The debugger then wants to further investigate the components in or near that block, which is difficult to determine due to the miniaturized components and (hidden)interconnects.

Currently, the debugger may employ conventional debugging techniques such as probe testing and inspecting design details of the PCB, i.e. a circuit layout, list of components, position of the components and netlist. A debugger however, not always has access to or has such information at their disposal.

With the presented method according to the first aspect of the disclosure, a processing unit such as a boundary-scan test device or general-purpose computer, will obtain the properties of boundary-scan compliant devices on the printed circuit board. The processing unit also obtains a listing of the interconnects between the devices on the PCB. Once this data is obtained, the processing unit knows the components and the interconnects and will obtain from the user, through a graphic user interface, a selection of the components and/or interconnects to provide visual representation thereof through the graphical user interface.

Thus at the development stage of the PCB the PCB designer may develop a boundary-scan test and determine that the outcome of the test is incorrect, e.g. components to not respond or respond different from what is expected, or he or she may discover that such a test cannot be executed or a smaller part than expected can be executed, due to certain aspects of the design. In such a case, the designer may start debugging to determine if components of the PCB interact with other components where the test fails or where the outcome of the test outcome is not as expected. This need not only arises during unexpected outcome of a test in the design stage but also during a failed test at the testing stage in which the PCB has already been assembled, but testing of the PCB points out that components or sub-blocks of components or interconnects are malfunctioning.

It was an insight of the inventor that for debugging of the PCB and/or debugging during development of the test-vectors for the PCB, and possibly also in other stages of the, there is a need for visualizing (part of) the circuit layout. This aids the debugger to obtain information required to solve the issue and re-run the test until its outcome is as expected. To this end, with the method according to the first aspect, the processing unit will generate and display, through a graphic user interface, a list of all components and the pins thereof. The user may select one of the pins of one of the components and based on that selection and the obtained boundary-scan properties of the boundary-scan compliant devices and the listing of interconnects, enable the processing unit to determine which further components in the circuit graph of the component of which the pin is selected, are connected thereto. The circuit graph with these components, hence the component having the selected pin, as well as any other component of the same circuit graph, is then shown to user through the graphical user interface such that the user is provided a simple and straightforward method for debugging.

In an example, said device is determined by receiving, by said processing unit, a selection of at least one printed circuit board.

In an example, said device is determined by receiving, by said processing unit, a selection of at least one device mounted on a printed circuit board of said selection of said at least one printed circuit board.

In an example, said device is determined by receiving, by said processing unit, a selection of a circuit terminal of one of said devices mounted on said printed circuit board.

The visualization method according to the first aspect for debugging a PCB is able to visualize the full or part of a circuit graph of a selection of the user through the graphical user interface. The selection may contain the PCB as a whole, which results in the visualization of plural circuit graphs with all components. The selection may also contain a single device which results in the visualization of the circuit graph with all components in that graph. And finally, the selection may also be a single pin or circuit terminal of a device such that the device or devices connected thereto and thus in that circuit graph are visualized.

In an example, said step of displaying, by said processing unit, comprises displaying a circuit graph of at least part of said devices, and wherein for each of said displayed devices properties are displayed corresponding to said device.

In an example, said properties comprise one or more of the group consisting of: number of circuit terminals, number of boundary-scan compliant circuit terminals, type of device, consecutive number identification of said type of device and interconnected circuit terminal.

In addition to visualization of the device, the information shown may also contain further information such as the number of pins or contact pads of that device, or information from which the user may observe which component it is, e.g. a resistor, microcontroller, etc.

In an example, said method further comprises: determining boundary-scan transparent devices from said listing of boundary scan properties and said connectivity properties, wherein said transparent devices are defined by devices through which data of a boundary-scan test is passed through said device in a non-adjusted manner.

The devices or components on the PCB may, for the purpose of boundary-scan be considered a transparent device. An example of such a transparent device is a resistor which, under certain circumstances, be considered a track for being a passive/non-active component. In this case, the circuit graph of which this transparent device forms part of, will contain components or devices on both pins of the transparent device. Thus, the circuit graph shown will visualize the graphs of both pins. In case of multiple transparent devices, more than two circuit graphs may be combined into one single graph, e.g. combining two, three or even more graphs into a single graph for display to the user.

Preferably, the user or debugger (developer, tester or service engineer), is able to select, or modify which of the components are transparent and thus will have visualized combined circuit graphs. If many of these transparent components are connected to each other, the visualized circuit graph may become too large for simple and straightforward presentation thereof through the graphical user interface. To this end, the method preferably comprises a step wherein input is obtained from the user of a maximum number of components in circuit graph.

In an example, said method further comprises: subjecting, by said processing unit, at least one boundary-scan compliant circuit terminal of a chain boundary-scan compliant circuit terminals of said boundary-scan compliant devices mounted on said printed circuit board to a boundary-scan test.

In an example, said boundary-scan test is operated for generating said connectivity properties of said devices mounted on said printed circuit board.

In an example, said boundary scan properties are retrieved from a Boundary Scan Description Language, BSDL, file of said at least one boundary-scan compliant device.

In an example, the method further comprises a graphical interface device, wherein at least one of said steps of displaying, receiving, operating and presenting are controlled from said graphical interface device.

In a second aspect of the present disclosure, a debugging arrangement is provided for debugging a printed circuit board, and/or at least one test-pattern for such printed circuit board, said printed circuit board comprising a plurality of devices mounted on said printed circuit board having circuit terminals for interconnecting said devices, said devices comprising at least one boundary-scan compliant device having boundary-scan compliant circuit terminals and comprising a boundary-scan register of boundary-scan cells of said boundary-scan compliant circuit terminals, said debugging arrangement comprising an electronic processing arranged for:retrieving boundary-scan properties of said at least one boundary-scan compliant device, said boundary-scan properties at least comprising a listing of boundary-scan compliant circuit terminals of said at least one boundary-scan compliant device;retrieving connectivity properties of said plurality of devices mounted on said printed circuit board, said connectivity properties at least comprising a listing of interconnects between said circuit terminals of said devices;displaying a circuit graph of at least a part of said devices mounted on said printed circuit board, said circuit graph comprising at least one device of said plurality of devices mounted on said printed circuit board and a least one further device from said plurality of devices which comprises a circuit terminal interconnected to a circuit terminal of said device for visualizing at least said device, said further device and interconnects between said devices for debugging said printed circuit board; wherein said device is determined by receiving, by said processing unit, a selection from one of the group of: said printed circuit board, said devices mounted on said printed circuit board, and a circuit terminal of one of said devices mounted on said printed circuit board.

In a third aspect of the present disclosure, a computer program product is provided comprising a data storage device storing thereon computer program code data arranged for performing the method of any of the above aspect and examples, when said program code data are loaded into a memory of an electronic processing unit and are executed by said electronic processing unit.

These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will be readily understood and appreciated by reference to the detailed description of the current embodiment and the drawings.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a rotary valve.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Rotary valves may be used in laboratory automation systems for distributing liquids, such as reagents, dilutions, samples, etc. A rotary valve usually comprises a stator member with stator channels and a rotor member, which comprises a rotor channel. Dependent on different rotary positions, the rotor channel interconnects different stator channels with each other. A pump may convey a liquid from a first container and/or channel into the rotary valve and the rotary valve may distribute the liquid into other containers and/or channels dependent on its rotor position. The rotary valve also may draw from one of a plurality of source containers and may distribute the fluid into a common outlet.

An important feature of any valve in a laboratory automation system is the flushing time, i.e. the time in which a first liquid in the valve can be substituted with another liquid. A fast flushing time of Su the valve may increase the overall throughput of an analytical instrument.

A second important feature of any valve in a laboratory automation system is the flushing volume, i.e. the volume required to substitute a first liquid in the valve with another liquid. The first liquid has to be flushed out completely by the other liquid in order to prevent cross contamination which may impact downstream processes/analyses. Small flushing volume may decrease flushing time and/or may save precious reagents.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,308,908 B2 shows a rotary valve with a stator channel in a stator member, which stator channel is transversely aligned to a rotation axis of a rotor member.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The objective of the invention is a rotary valve with a reduced flushing time.

This objective is met by the subject-matter of the independent claim. Further exemplary embodiments are evident from the dependent claims and the following description.

The invention relates to a rotary valve comprising a stator member with a planar stator face, the stator member having a plurality of stator channels for conducting a fluid and a rotor member with a planar rotor face facing and in contact with the stator face, the rotor member having at least one rotor channel. The rotor member is rotatable with respect to the stator member about a rotation axis, such that in a conduction position, the rotor channel interconnects two of the stator channels and the two stator channels are in fluid communication. The stator face and the rotor face may be parallel. The rotation axis may be aligned orthogonally to the stator face and the rotor face.

The stator member and the rotor member may be accommodated in a housing of the rotary valve, wherein the stator member may be statically connected with the housing and the rotor member may be rotatably connected with the housing. The rotor member may be rotated by a step motor. A pump, such as an automatically actuated syringe, may be connected to one of the stator channels. The housing of the rotary valve furthermore may comprise means for pressing the rotor face against the stator face, such as a spring.

The stator member and/or the rotor member may be made of a ceramics material e.g. alumina, metal e.g. stainless steel or polymer e.g. PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) or ETFE (Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene). The stator channels may be made of bores machined in the material before or after sintering or formed by inserting a wire before pressing or molding, which are removed after forming. The rotor channel may be made by machining a groove into the material. It also may be that the rotor member and/or the stator member are 3D printed, for example by laser sintering.

There may be more than one conduction position. It may be that the stator member has a stator channel with a central opening that opens into the rotor channel in any conduction position. It may be that the stator member has one or more eccentric stator channels with an opening spaced apart from the rotation axis. In a specific conduction position, one of the eccentric stator channels may be connected with the stator channel with the central opening.

According to an embodiment of the invention, at least one of the stator channels has a transverse channel section opening into the stator face and running transversely with respect to the stator face, the rotor face and/or the rotation axis. Transverse may mean that a central line of the transfers channel is not orthogonal with respect to the stator face and/or the rotor face. Transverse may mean that a central line of the transverse channel projected onto a plane comprising the rotation axis is not parallel and is not orthogonal. The transverse channel section may have a cylindrical form and/or may have a circular cross-section. It also may be that the transverse channel section has an ellipsoid, egg shaped or polygonal cross-section. The interface of the transverse channel section and the stator face may be elongated, such as egg-shaped or ellipsoidal.

With a transverse channel section, the overall length of the fluid path through the stator member and the rotor member may be shortened. This may decrease the flushing time. With a transverse channel orientation, the flushing performance may be improved compared to an orthogonal orientation.

The at least one stator channel with the transverse channel section may be an eccentric stator channel. In the case, the stator member has more than one eccentric stator channel, each of the eccentric stator channels may have a transverse channel section. At least some of the transverse channel sections may be symmetric with respect to each other by rotation about the rotation axis.

It also may be that there is one or more pairs of stator channels, which are interconnected by a rotor channel. Both stator channels of a pair may have transverse channel sections. It also may be that one stator channel of a pair has a transverse channel section and that the other one is orthogonally aligned to the stator face. The pairs of stator channels may be symmetric with respect to each other by rotation about the rotation axis.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the rotor channel has a bottom, which at an intersection end of the rotor channel is inclined with respect to the rotor face, the stator face and/or the rotation axis, such that the rotor channel elongates an inner surface of the stator channel, when the rotor member is in the conducting position. As transverse, inclined may mean that the bottom has a substantially flat bottom surface and/or substantially straight bottom line, which is angled with respect to the rotor face, the stator face and/or the rotation axis. By elongating the stator channel and in particular the transverse channel section with the rotor channel, substantial continuous surfaces may be formed.

With the inclined bottom of the rotor channel, turbulences and/or vorticities in the transition between the rotor channel and the stator channel may be reduced. This also may reduce the flushing time, since a more laminar fluid flow may be achieved. Furthermore, a reduced flushing volume may be achieved by avoiding dead points.

An inclined bottom of the rotor channel may be provided by a rotor channel, which at the intersection end becomes deeper with increasing distance from the outermost position of the rotor channel. Over a range, the increase of the depth may be linear with respect to the distance to the outermost position.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the rotor channel is a groove in the rotor face. Over its complete extension, the rotor channel always may be opened towards the rotor face.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the rotor channel has a U-shaped cross-section. The bottom surface of the rotor channel may have a substantial circular cross-section.

According to an embodiment of the invention, a bottom line of the rotor channel at the intersection end is inclined with respect to the rotor face, the stator face and/or the rotation axis. The bottom line may be composed of the lowest points of the U-shaped cross-sections along the extension of the rotor channel.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the bottom of the rotor channel at the interconnection end is inclined with respect to the rotor face, the stator face and/or the rotation axis with the same angle as the stator channel. In such a way, a cylindrical shape of the transverse channel section of the stator channel may be elongated substantially flush with the rotor channel.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the bottom of the rotor channel at a second interconnection end, which opens into a further stator channel, which may be a parallel stator channel, is aligned orthogonally to the rotation axis (and/or parallel to the rotor face and/or the stator face). The first interconnection end may be used for interconnecting the rotor channel with a transverse channel section of a (for example eccentric) stator channel. The second interconnection end may be used for interconnecting the rotor channel with a parallel stator channel. The rotor channel may have an inclined part at the first interconnection end, which transitions into an orthogonally aligned part at the second interconnection end.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the rotor channel extends radially with respect to the rotation axis. The rotor channel may be substantially straight. One end of the rotor channel may be at the center of the rotor member, i.e. at the rotation axis.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the rotor channel extends tangential with respect to a circle around the rotation axis. It also may be that there are a plurality of rotor channels, which may be distributed symmetrically with respect to the rotation axis.

According to an embodiment of the invention, a center line of the transverse channel section intersects with the rotation axis. In other words, the rotation axis and the stator channel may be arranged in one plane.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the transverse channel section has an opening in the stator face, which at a side, where an angle between the transverse channel section and the stator face is acute, has a side wall running parallel to the rotation axis. An acute part of the stator member between the transverse channel section and the stator face may be removed. This may reduce the danger of damages of the stator member at this position. The volume produced by material removed from the stator member, i.e. the volume between a cylindrical part of the transverse channel section and the parallel side wall, may be small, such that this nearly does not influence the flushing time.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the stator member comprises a parallel stator channel, which runs parallel to and/or along the rotation axis of the rotor member. The parallel stator channel may be the only input and/or output of the rotary valve from which the fluid is distributed to and/or collected from the eccentric stator channels, which then act as outputs and/or inputs. Both sections may have a circular cross-section and/or may be centred with respect to each other.

It also may be that a parallel stator channel is running spaced apart from the rotation axis. For example, pairs of stator channels, which are arranged symmetrically around the rotation axis may have a parallel stator channel.

A connection port may be a substantially cylindrical opening in the rotary valve for connecting pipes or hoses to the rotary valve. The connection ports, which may be designed to receive screwed fittings, may be provided by the stator member or a further member of the rotary valve arranged on a surface of the stator member opposite to the stator face.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the parallel stator channel has a first section opening into the rotor channel and a second section opening towards a connection port of the rotary valve. The second section has a smaller diameter as the first section. This may help forming a laminar fluid flow between the connection port and the parallel stator channel and/or also may reduce the flushing time.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the stator member comprises a circular groove surrounding the stator face. The circular groove may have an inclined surface, which is inclined with respect to the rotation axis. The transverse channel section(s) of the one or more eccentric stator channels may run along this circular groove. In particular, the transverse channel sections open the possibility, such that such a groove can be formed in the stator. With the groove, the stator may be designed more compact. The circular groove also may provide space so that any leakage between the rotor member and stator member may leave the rotary valve through a drain hole, rather than forcing through the sealed bearing and possibly damaging the bearing and/or valve.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the inclined surface is inclined with respect to the rotation axis with the same angle as the transverse channel section. In such a way, material between the inclined surface and the transverse channel sections may be spared.

According to an embodiment of the invention, a bearing surrounding the rotor member protrudes into the circular groove. The bearing may be used for supporting a rotation of the rotor. An overall length of the rotary valve may be reduced. The bearing may be a sliding bearing or a ball bearing.

According to an embodiment of the invention, the stator channel with the transverse channel section has a parallel channel section, which opens towards a connection port of the rotary valve. The parallel channel section runs parallel to the rotation axis. The transverse channel section and the parallel channel section may have the same diameter and/or may have a circular cross-section. The connection port to the stator channel may be aligned parallel to the rotation axis. In such a way, a laminar fluid flow between the stator channel and the connection port is supported. This also may support reducing the flushing time.

These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.

The following relates to wireless communications, including resource aggregation for dynamic antenna port adaptation.

BACKGROUND

Wireless communications systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as voice, video, packet data, messaging, broadcast, and so on. These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include one or more network entities, each supporting wireless communication for communication devices, which may be known as user equipment (UE).

Some wireless communications systems may support network entities (e.g., base stations, base station components, network access entities, access nodes, or the like) that implement communications using a relatively large number of antenna units (e.g., compared to some other wireless communications systems) and thus consume relatively large amounts of energy. To conserve power, a network entity may dynamically adapt a number of active antenna elements, which may be referred to as dynamic antennal panel adaptation, dynamic antenna port adaptation, or the like. In some examples, however, operations at a UE being served by the network entity may be affected by antenna port adaptation.

SUMMARY

The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, and apparatuses that support resource aggregation for dynamic antenna port adaptation. For example, the described techniques provide for aggregating or separating a set of channel state information (CSI) resources to obtain a CSI resource (e.g., a new CSI resource) associated with a different number of antenna ports than respective CSI resources of the set of CSI resources. As an example, a user equipment (UE) may determine and report CSI feedback to a network entity based on receiving and measuring one or more CSI reference signals (CSI-RSs) transmitted over one or more CSI resources by the network entity. The UE may modify one or more feedback operations according to the number of antenna ports used by the network entity for measuring and reporting CSI and may aggregate or separate respective CSI resources each having a first number of antenna ports to obtain a new CSI resource having a second number of antenna ports (e.g., allowed antenna ports) for reporting CSI feedback. In such cases, the new CSI resource may be associated with a number of antenna ports that matches the number of antenna ports used by the network entity (e.g., based on dynamic antenna port adaptation). In some examples, the CSI feedback from the UE may indicate a particular CSI-RS resource (e.g., for communications between the network entity and the UE) without changing (e.g., increasing) a number of bits in a CSI-RS resource indicator bitfield of the feedback, thereby conserving overhead.

A method for wireless communication at a UE is described. The method may include receiving a control message from a network entity indicating a CSI report configuration, the CSI report configuration indicating a set of resources and one or more codebook configurations, performing an operation to obtain one or more CSI resources from the set of resources based on a first number of antenna ports associated with each resource of the set of resources and a second number of antenna ports associated with a codebook configuration of the one or more codebook configurations, where performing the operation obtains the one or more CSI resources for measuring CSI on the one or more CSI resources, measuring the CSI for a set of reference signals received on the one or more CSI resources, and transmitting a CSI report based on the measured CSI for the set of reference signals received on the one or more CSI resources.

An apparatus for wireless communication at a UE is described. The apparatus may include a processor, memory coupled with the processor, and instructions stored in the memory. The instructions may be executable by the processor to cause the apparatus to receive a control message from a network entity indicating a CSI report configuration, the CSI report configuration indicating a set of resources and one or more codebook configurations, perform an operation to obtain one or more CSI resources from the set of resources based on a first number of antenna ports associated with each resource of the set of resources and a second number of antenna ports associated with a codebook configuration of the one or more codebook configurations, where performing the operation obtains the one or more CSI resources for measuring CSI on the one or more CSI resources, measure the CSI for a set of reference signals received on the one or more CSI resources, and transmit a CSI report based on the measured CSI for the set of reference signals received on the one or more CSI resources.

Another apparatus for wireless communication at a UE is described. The apparatus may include means for receiving a control message from a network entity indicating a CSI report configuration, the CSI report configuration indicating a set of resources and one or more codebook configurations, means for performing an operation to obtain one or more CSI resources from the set of resources based on a first number of antenna ports associated with each resource of the set of resources and a second number of antenna ports associated with a codebook configuration of the one or more codebook configurations, where performing the operation obtains the one or more CSI resources for measuring CSI on the one or more CSI resources, means for measuring the CSI for a set of reference signals received on the one or more CSI resources, and means for transmitting a CSI report based on the measured CSI for the set of reference signals received on the one or more CSI resources.

11893472	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to the technical field of compensation of measuring devices for production parameters in the evaporation process of alumina, in particular to an accuracy compensation method for a discharge caustic alkali concentration measuring device in an evaporation process.

BACKGROUND

The caustic alkali concentration is a key process index in the evaporation process of alumina. Whether the caustic alkali concentration is qualified or not will directly affect the ratio of grinding process and the dissolution rate of dissolution process of alumina, thus affecting the quality of final product of alumina. Therefore, on-line measuring of the caustic alkali concentration is a very important task in alumina production.

At present, there are usually two methods to detect the concentration of the caustic alkali. One method is to obtain it by manual sampling and laboratory test after the preparation of alkali liquor in the evaporation process. Because the sampling interval is long (usually 2 hours or 4 hours) and the laboratory test takes a long time, there is a serious lag in the measuring of the caustic alkali concentration. It is easy to cause large fluctuations in the concentration of the caustic alkali and a low qualification rate of alkali liquor by using these seriously lagging information to guide the production, resulting in difficulties in controlling other processes, and ultimately resulting in low alumina quality. The other method is using caustic alkali concentration on-line measuring instruments, but these on-line instruments are expensive, and usually the internal model parameters of the instruments are fixed after installation. Since the raw ore composition used by some alumina enterprises fluctuates greatly, the evaporation process conditions are complex and changeable. Therefore, with the passage of time, the output value of the on-line measuring device may drift, the accuracy of the instruments may decrease, and the enterprises need to invest a lot of money in maintenance, and the recalibration process is cumbersome.

{X⁡(k)=140⁢∑i=039X⁡(i)X⁡(k+1)=140⁢∑i=4079X⁡(i)X⁡(k+2)=140⁢∑i=80119X⁡(i)(2)where X(i) is a value at the ithtime after filtering, and X(k) is process data matching a laboratory value at the kthpoint.

Preferably, the normalization in step 2 normalizes states of input and output variables used in the accuracy compensation model of the caustic alkali concentration measuring device:

Using a double-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for the deep learning algorithm to establish the accuracy compensation model of the caustic alkali concentration measuring device.

Preferably, the compensation method further comprises evaluating the accuracy compensation model of the caustic alkali concentration measuring device by using a root mean square error, a mean absolute error, and a mean absolute percentage error:

wherein a formula for calculating the root mean square error is:

RMSE=∑i=0N-1(yi-y^i)2N(4)

12025476	"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

This disclosure generally relates to an optical encoding system and, more particularly, to an optical encoding system and an operating method thereof that can mitigate the phase shift between detection signals caused by position deviations in assembling.

BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

The optical rotation encoder can be adapted to detect an absolute position or a relative position of unlimited rotating shaft. The relative position encoder can be adapted to an application such as an optical mouse. The absolute position encoder can be adapted to applications such as an aerospace camera and a robotic system.

The optical rotation encoder generally includes a code disk and a photodiode array. The photodiode array has an incremental photodiodes for receiving modulated light from the code disk to output differential quadrature signals having 90-degree phase shift from one another to confirm a relative position change. In order to confirm an absolute position at the same time, the photodiode array further includes another photodiode group for outputting detection signals, which are used in conjunction with the maximum length sequence (MLS) code to determine a rotation angle of the code disk.

However, in assembling the optical rotation encoder, the assembly error can occur to induce the phase shift(s) between the detection signals. For example,FIG.1Ais a schematic diagram of modulated light impinging on a photodiode diode array11when there is no position deviation between the code disk and the photodiode diode array11, wherein the photodiode diode array11is shown to include nine photodiodes C1to C9; and reference numerals13band13drespectively indicate bright zones and dark zones of modulated light from the code disk.

When there is no significant assembly error between the code disk and the photodiode array11, detection signals Sc1to Sc9of the photodiodes C1to C9do not have a phase shift therebetween, e.g., referring toFIG.1B.

However, if there is the assembly error between the code disk and the photodiode array11, phase shifts occur between the detection signals Sc1to Sc9of the photodiodes C1to C9. For example referring toFIG.2A, it shows that impinging light zones have a small magnification factor such that the bright zones13band the dark zones13dof modulated light are smaller than sensing surfaces of the photodiodes C1to C9, wherein phase shifts between the detection signals Sc1to Sc9are shown inFIG.2C. Referring toFIG.2B, it shows that impinging light zones have a large magnification factor such that the bright zones13band the dark zones13dof modulated light are larger than the sensing surfaces of the photodiodes C1to C9, wherein phase shifts between detection signals Sc1to Sc9are shown inFIG.2D.

In the case that the detection signals of the photodiodes C1to C9are used as absolute position signals, this kind of phase shifts can lead to code error, or called absolute code jump.

Accordingly, it is required to provide an optical encoding system capable of mitigating or even eliminating the phase shift between detection signals caused by the assembling error.

SUMMARY

The present disclosure provides an optical encoding system with photodiodes transversally divided into multiple sub-regions such that when a phase shift between detection signals exceeds a predetermined threshold, the currently operating photodiodes are switched to different sub-regions so as to match modulated light zones thereby eliminating phase shifts caused by the position deviation in assembling.

The present disclosure further provides an optical encoding system with longitudinally arranged multiple photodiode arrays such that when a phase shift between detection signals exceeds a predetermined threshold, the currently operating photodiodes are switched to different combinations among the multiple photodiode arrays so as to match modulated light zones thereby eliminating phase shifts caused by the position deviation in assembling.

The present disclosure provides an optical encoding system including a code disk, a photodiode array and a processor. The code disk is arranged with equally-spaced multiple code slits along a tangential direction. The photodiode array includes multiple groups of detection photodiodes and two groups of calibration photodiodes respectively at two sides of the multiple groups of detection photodiodes in the tangential direction, wherein the multiple groups of detection photodiodes are respectively configured to receive modulated light from the multiple code slits to generate a detection signal as absolute position signals. The processor identifies whether to switch to use the two groups of calibration photodiodes according to phase shifts between multiple detection signals generated by the multiple groups of detection photodiodes. Each group of the multiple groups of detection photodiodes and the two groups of calibration photodiodes have multiple sub-photodiodes, and the processor is further configured to sum up light energy detected by the multiple sub-photodiodes of the each group to generate the detection signals.

The present disclosure further provides an optical encoding system including a first photodiode array, a second photodiode array, a third photodiode array and a processor. The first photodiode array has a first width in a first direction, and is used to generate multiple detection signals as absolute position signals. The second photodiode array has a second width in the first direction, and is arranged at a first side of the first photodiode array in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction, wherein the second width is smaller than the first width. The third photodiode array has a third width in the first direction, and is arranged at a second side of the first photodiode array in the second direction, wherein the third width is larger than the first width. The processor identifies whether to switch to use the second photodiode array or the third photodiode array according to phase shifts between the multiple detection signals.

The present disclosure further provides an optical encoding system including a code disk, multiple detection photodiodes, multiple calibration photodiodes and a processor. The code disk is arranged with equally-spaced multiple code slits along a tangential direction. The multiple detection photodiodes respectively receive modulated light from the multiple code slits to generate a detection signal as absolute position signals. The processor identifies whether to switch to use the multiple calibration photodiodes according to phase shifts between multiple detection signals generated by the multiple detection photodiodes.

The present system relates to cardiac sensing systems using combined electrocardiographic (EKG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensing systems.

Brief Description of the Clinical Problem

Venous hemoglobin oxygenation in health is often greater than 80%. While this may seem surprising, this high level of oxygenation represents a metabolic reserve that the body can dip into even though a deep breath has not been taken in the last few seconds. In states of stress that reserve will be whittled away; as such venous saturation is clinically useful as it provides a measure of the body's oxygen reserve. Currently this can only be obtained via an invasive venous blood gas measurement. Venous oxygen saturation and serum lactate are both used to measure a patient's degree of metabolic reserve and stress, as venous saturation is depressed in times of metabolic stress. Serum lactate will rise when tissues are not receiving sufficient oxygen to meet the metabolic needs, and the tissues turn to anaerobic use of glucose. Currently, the most common measure for evaluation of metabolic stress is a serum lactate, though recent studies such asSerum Lactate Poorly Predicts Central Venous Oxygen Saturation In Critically Ill Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Studyby Bisara et. al., PMID: 21516712, DOI: 10.1186/s40560-019-0401-5, suggest venous oxygen saturation may be a better early measure of stress before onset of critical decompensation. Serum measurement of lactate, or a venous blood gas, requires aseptic blood drawing capacity and a qualified laboratory nearby capable of expeditiously running a venous sample that has been put on ice after blood draw. The capability of non-invasively measuring venous oxygenation saturation therefore has tremendous implications for assessing metabolic stress in both resource-rich and resource-limited situations.

Summary of the Invention and Cardiac Physiology Germane to the Invention

In preferred aspects, the present system determines venous oxygen saturation in a system that comprises: (a) a device positionable against a person's skin; (b) at least one PPG sensor mounted on the device for measuring the person's PPG signal at multiple wavelengths of light; (c) a plurality of electrodes for measuring the person's EKG signal; (d) a computer logic system for receiving and analyzing the PPG signal and the EKG signal, wherein the computer logic system further comprises: (i) a system for identifying cardiac cycles in the EKG signal; (ii) a system for segmenting the PPG signal into a series of PPG signal segments based upon features in the identified cardiac cycles, (iii) a system for sorting the PPG signal segments into a plurality of bins, each bin based upon durations of prior R-to-R cardiac cycles and current R-to-R cardiac cycles, (iv) a system for generating a composite signal for each of the plurality of bins, and (v) a system for measuring a person's venous oxygen saturation by: (a) calculating arterial oxygen saturation by comparing composite signals measured at different wavelengths of light, (b) sub-sampling composite signals at two consecutive signal maxima measured at different wavelengths of light, and (c) comparing the sub-sampled composite signals measured at different wavelengths of light to the calculated arterial oxygen saturation to determine venous oxygen saturation. Preferably, the arterial oxygen saturation is calculated by comparing composite signals measured at different wavelengths of light which comprises comparing composite Signal Prime Over Signal (SPOS) signals, each composite SPOS signal being the derivative of a composite signal normalized by the composite signal itself.

In preferred aspects, the present system for measuring a person's venous oxygen saturation selects preferred bins from which the composite signals are used when calculating the person's venous oxygen saturation, and the preferred bins correspond to the bins having the largest number of PPG signal segments therein and/or the largest difference between current and prior R-to-R values. A composite signal may be generated for each bin by summing or averaging the PPG signal segments in the bin. In addition, the composite signal may be used to generate a composite Signal Prime Over Signal (SPOS) which is the derivative of the composite signal normalized by the composite signal itself. In such aspects, a system for calculating arterial oxygen saturation by comparing composite SPOS signals measured at different wavelengths of light may be included.

In preferred aspects, the system for generating a composite signal for each of the plurality of bins comprises a system for removing aberrant PPG signal segments from the calculation of the composite signal, for example, by iteratively re-calculating the composite signal, by: comparing a SPOS of each of the PPG signal segments used to calculate a composite signal against the SPOS of the calculated composite signal, removing outlier PPG signal segments, re-calculating the composite signal with the outlier PPG signal segments removed, and repeating the iteration until there are no more outlier PPG signal segments.

In various preferred physical embodiments illustrated herein, the present system is a hand-held device with the at least one PPG sensor mounted thereon and a plurality of electrode wires extending therefrom or mounted thereon. Alternatively, the present system may be positioned within a strap or band disposed around the person's chest or limb with at least one PPG sensor and the plurality of electrodes are disposed within the strap or band. Alternatively, the present system may be disposed in a patch with the at least one PPG sensor and at least one of the plurality of electrodes positioned therein. Systems are also provided for data transmission.

The present system provides information regarding the metabolic reserve/stress of a given patient, inexpensively and non-invasively. Such knowledge can provide clinicians with critical point-of-care information about the clinical trajectory of a patient's recovery or decline quickly and safely, without having to wait on laboratory results. At heart is the analysis ofFIG.1showing the system top-level flow diagram for estimating venous saturation, wherein the hemoglobin saturation of arterial blood is obtained from the main-pulse region of a composite PPG signal shape (101), i.e. the region of greatest slope change, and a separate estimation of venous blood hemoglobin oxygenation is obtained using only end-pulse signal maxima/arterial pulse minima (102). The two results are then compared to determine how much oxygen reserve is apparent.

The key to this analysis is understanding that the dynamics of the “tissue sandwich”, through which the PPG signal is filtered, changes slightly at the end of the pulse. This seen inFIG.2. The curve201is an experimentally obtained arterial waveform, derived from a composite IR PPG signal. As one can see, the waveform is incredibly clean, the result of intelligent similar pulse averaging over a number of minutes. The salient point is that, were the arterial pulse descent from the peak (or “roll-off”) a simple exponential, or even a steady decline, the curve would not result in the “hump” seen prior to the pulse minimum just prior to the onset of the next pulse (202).

Rather than passive draining, in this time frame there is active filling of arterioles, in essence priming an “hour glass” structure consisting of the arterioles, capillaries (through which blood cells pass one-by-one), and venules. This priming effect causes a change in the composition of the blood measured by PPG oximetry. Capitalizing on this observation, that the blood composition is changing just prior to the end of the pulse, signal maxima (corresponding to arterial pulse minima) are gathered together and analyzed independently from the PPG signal obtained through the pulse. A pictorial depiction of this approach is provided inFIG.3, showing LED sampling inFIG.3A, standard PPG arterial hemoglobin oximetry, andFIG.3Bend-pulse/signal maxima sampling. Line302shows the arterial pulse sampled via standard oximetry, through which LED signal (301) sampling occurs. Line303is the resultant PPG signal. Point304shows a signal maxima/pulse minima.FIG.3Bshows the different sampling done in end-pulse/signal maxima oximetry. Line306shows the arterial pulse, through which LED signal (305) sampling occurs, though only at end-pulse, signal maxima. Line307is the resultant PPG signal with such sampling.

Further depiction of the structure being measured at arterial end-pulse can be seen inFIG.4. InFIG.4Athe arteriole/capillary/venule structure is shown as an hourglass. Through the main portion of the arterial pulse, an hourglass representing the arteriole/capillary/venule structure measured in reflective oximetry is dominated by the maximally oxygenated, pre-capillary arteriole blood (401). However, at end-pulse there is piling up of the venule, post-capillary blood, depicted in402.FIG.4Bgives another representation of the structure, with the structure measured in reflective oximetry is shown as a shaded area (403). Also seen is a graph with a curve of the velocity of blood movement (404). This shows the blood cells slowing to their lowest velocity as they pass through the capillaries, with an asymmetry in velocity prior and post capillaries, explaining the change in arteriole to venule blood at end-pulse.

The approach is further explained inFIGS.5A and5B, showing changes between the sampling points (the R-to-R duration) as linear, and how the PPG signal may change. Area501shows the end-pulse arterial (pre-capillary) blood, and area502the end-pulse venous (post-capillary) blood; area503is the fixed elements of the structure (largely connective tissue). InFIG.5ALED sampling through the structure at end-pulse/signal maxima (504) before and after long pulses yields PPG signals505and506, separated by time507(R-to-R duration). InFIG.5BLED sampling through the structure at end-pulse/signal maxima (504) before and after short pulses yields PPG signals508and509, separated by time510(R-to-R duration).

The present system uses combined electrocardiography (EKG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals (PPG is also commonly referred to as oximetry and the two terms will be used interchangeably throughout this specification). The former senses voltage produced by heart muscle contraction, and the latter measures light absorbed by tissues. Changes in PPG signal reflect changes in blood volume and measurement at different wavelengths allows determination of oxygen saturation.

The present system allows different insight than is currently available using hand-held, portable PPG systems/devices. The combination of EKG and PPG signals in this system utilize Pulse Wave Transit Time (or PWTT), and PPG Signal Prime Over Signal (SPOS) curves. PWTT is the period of time taken between a heartbeat as measured by the onset of the QRS complex and the time at which the blood from the aorta reaches an extremity or other body part, as determined by the negative spike generated in the SPOS curve, also described as the derivative of the LED signal divided by the signal. Use of the signal derivative to determine the change in a LED signal heralding the arrival of an arterial pulse has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,213,123, assigned to MocaCare Corporation of Palo Alto, California, however use of the signal prime over signal (SPOS) allows for greater insight, as it normalizes each wavelength signal and thus allows for comparisons between different wavelength SPOS curves.

Improved arterial oxygen saturation estimation is then generated by this system from an SPOS curve using a composite sum/average of similar pulses, with the added ability to generate oxygen saturation for selected segments of the cardiac cycle, specifically end-pulse oximetry. Prior (n−1) EKG R-to-R duration using R-wave peaks are calculated, as are Current (n) R-to-R duration, PWTT, and SPOS. These are all used by the present system to determine similarity of oximetry pulses, with similar pulses summed/averaged to form composite pulses, then comparing differing composite pulses to gain cardiovascular insight.

Reduced PWTT corresponds to greater pulse wave velocity, though the greater velocity does not indicate better pump function. This is because the aortic bulb acts as a “mechanical capacitor”, allowing metered delivery of arterial pulse volume. However, having obtained the PWTT for any given monitoring point on the body, this metric remains relatively stable and changes only gradually barring a sudden change in cardiovascular state (e.g. sudden change in heart rhythm such as onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response). PWTT therefore provides a means by which to ensure accurate further data collection and analysis. This allows more reliable extraction of additional information from the combination of signals, and removal/minimization of introduced noise.

Measurement of absorption of light (per Beer-Lambert law) has the form Measurement(t)=Ke[−Cf(t)], and the signal prime over signal (SPOS) of the measurement will be:

S⁢P⁢O⁢S⁡(t)=-C(df⁡(t)d⁢t).

The LED signals in plethysmography have the form:
Signal=K*e[−Arterial(t)*Σ(α*Hb)arterial]*e[−Venous(t)*Σ(α*Hb)venous](1)

Σ(α*Hb)arterialand Σ(α*Hb)venousdescribe the composition of the blood and generally change slowly. Therefore, these two terms are constants across time for the duration of our sampling. (These terms will be explained in greater detail herein).

Further, in healthy individuals, the venous flow is considered a constant. Current oximetry measures assume this, and so will we for this initial exploration. Given this assumption, the equation reduces to:
Signal=K1*e[−Arterial(t)*Σ(α*Hb)arterial](2)

Using properties of the exponential function, and of its derivative, we derive the SPOS for the PPG Signal at several wavelengths (e.g., IR and Red).

S⁢P⁢O⁢S⁢(t)=-(dArterial⁡(t)dt)*∑(α*Hb)arterial(3)

Using the fact that the conceptual function Arterial(t) is the same for both Red and IR PPG signals, we show that the SPOS of the signal from the IR LED (SPOSIR) is directly proportional to the SPOS of the signal from the Red LED (SPOSRed):
SPOSRed=R*SPOSIRor SPOSRed/SPOSIR=R(4)

Returning to the expression

∑(αμHbx*Hbx)
This describes how different wavelengths of light are absorbed by the blood depending on the relative quantity of the types of hemoglobin present within.

Where:

αμH⁢bx=absorption⁢coefficient⁢for⁢type⁢of⁢⁢hemoglobin⁢(deoxyhemoglobin,oxyhemoglobin,carboxyhemoglobin,methemoglobin),x,for⁢the⁢wavelength,μ

Hbx=fractional composition of blood of various types of hemoglobin. The Sum of fractional components of different types of hemoglobin=1.0

In the conditions of low levels of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin (e.g. excepting situations such as carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning), and using accepted standard absorption coefficients for αIRHb, αRedHb, Hb=1−Hb02.

We end up with the equation:

(αRedHb02*Hb02)+(αRedHb*(1-Hb02))=R*[(αIRHb02*Hb02)+(αIRHb*(1-Hb02))](5)

The only unknown is Hb02. Solving for Hb02gives us the fraction of the blood that is oxygenated (Arterial oxygenated hemoglobin Fraction, or Arterial Frac O2):

Arterial⁢Frac⁢O2=(-αIRHb*R+αR⁢e⁢d⁢H⁢b)R*(αIRHbO2-αIRHb)+(αR⁢e⁢d⁢H⁢b-αR⁢e⁢d⁢H⁢b⁢O2)(6)

This direct proportionality between SPOS for any wavelength and the summation of optical absorption coefficients times the fraction of hemoglobin is used extensively by the present system.

Any recording of EKG, or oximetry signals, or their interaction, will have physiologic variability, as well as noise. Management of EKG noise have established protocols that have been built up over 100 years. Conditioning of oximetry signals do not have as long a history. Physiologic oximetry variability can occur from changes in venous flow (due to volitional movement, or passive movement from repositioning, or inflation/deflation of a blood pressure cuff/sphygmomanometer, etc.), respiration causing changes in intra-thoracic pressure with resultant change in blood volume return to the heart, or beat-to-beat duration variability. Noise, or non-physiologic variability, can also occur from a range of possibilities, from variation in the surface pressure and angle of application of the detector, to ambient light infection of signal collection, to DC drift of the detection circuit. Whatever the specific source of variation, without an intelligent approach to the signals, one cannot tell physiologic variability apart from non-physiologic variability (introduced noise).

Traditional means for dealing with noise introduced into oximetry signals is to filter. For example, a commonly used algorithm for detecting signal to noise ratio utilizes power within the frequencies below 20 Hz compared with power above this frequency (as described in MaximIntegrated AppNote AN6410.pdf provided by Maxim Integrated Corporation of San Jose, California). This frequency filtering highlights the underlying primary rhythm (heart rate) and smooths the appearance of the displayed waveform. However, pulses are not all the same, and treating them as if they are deletes valuable information that can be mined for deeper insight.

An alternative means by which to minimize variability is to average the oximetry over many pulses, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,485,433, assigned to Intel Corporation. This allows for minimization of introduced noise, but eliminates any information that could be gleaned from physiologic variability. This approach produces a single, homogenized, and representative pulse at the end of the process. However, pulses are not all the same, and treating them as if they are effectively obliterates some of the available information.

With the observation ofFIG.2, a re-evaluation of the assumption of a flat venous blood profile (as in equation (1)) can be done. The combination of more or less arteriole filling/emptying and more or less right ventricular filling with differing R-to-R will be seen in varying PPG signal maxima, with both venule volume and arteriole volume changing at signal maxima (FIG.5). The ratio of arteriole and venule composition in this delta volume is not yet entirely clear. However, the approach shows that an enlarging difference between end-pulse oximetry and arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation calculated from the rising pulse (main-pulse oximetry) reflects falling venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation.

11879135	"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to a method for determining the undifferentiated state of pluripotent stem cells, a method for subculturing pluripotent stem cells, and a device method for use in the methods.

BACKGROUND ART

Pluripotent stem cells are widely used in various fields such as researches on tissue differentiation, drug testing, and regenerative medicine because of their pluripotency to differentiate into any tissue. Especially, since the establishment of iPS cells, researches in this field have been remarkably developed, and various approaches for realizing regenerative medicine have been made worldwide.

Incidentally, pluripotent stem cells are easy to differentiate and may lose their pluripotency once they differentiate. Therefore, pluripotent stem cells must be cultured while their undifferentiated states are maintained. Maintaining the undifferentiated state can be said to be one of the most important elements in the culture of pluripotent stem cells.

In order to maintain the undifferentiated state, for example, an agent that inhibits differentiation is used, and pluripotent stem cells that have started to differentiate are removed. One of the biggest obstacles to large-scale preparation of pluripotent stem cells is to remove pluripotent stem cells that have started to differentiate. Insufficient removal of the cells that have started to differentiate may induce the differentiation of surrounding cells and adversely affect the entire cultured cells. However, it is difficult to determine whether pluripotent stem cells are in the undifferentiated state without relying on a skilled technician. For these reasons, large-scale preparation of pluripotent stem cells is naturally limited. Therefore, at least, the development of a method for confirming whether pluripotent stem cells are in the undifferentiated state without relying on a skilled technician's judgement and the development of a method for automatically determining pluripotent stem cells that have started to differentiate have been demanded.

As methods for confirming whether pluripotent stem cells are in the undifferentiated state, a qRT-PCR method, an immunostaining method, and a flow cytometric method have been used so far (Non-Patent Literature 1). However, the qRT-PCR method and the immunostaining method requires destruction of cells at the time of measurement. The flow cytometric method allows for nondestructive measurement, but requires suspension of cells in a single cell state, which may involve complicated operations. Therefore, noninvasive culture environment/cell quality control techniques are needed in the culture of pluripotent stem cells in regenerative medicine.

In recent years, the present inventors have reported medium analysis component analysis techniques as noninvasive culture environment/cell quality monitoring methods. Patent Literature 1 discloses a method for determining the undifferentiated state of pluripotent stem cells, comprising the step of evaluating the undifferentiated state of pluripotent stem cells based on a change over time in variation value of an extracellular metabolite contained in a culture medium in which the pluripotent stem cells are cultured, wherein the extracellular metabolite is at least one selected from the group consisting of L-glutamic acid, L-alanine and ammonia.

Patent Literature 2 discloses a method for evaluating the differentiation state of cells, comprising using stem cells which are unknown in undifferentiated state or cells which have been differentiation-induced from stem cells, as test cells, to evaluate the differentiation state of the test cells based on the amount of a predetermined indicator substance present in a culture medium of the test cells, wherein the indicator substance is at least one compound selected from the group consisting of ornithine, 2-aminoadipic acid, deoxycytidine, glutamic acid, tryptophan, asparagine, alanine, cystine, hypoxanthine, uridine, aspartic acid, arginine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 2-hydroxyvaleric acid, 3-hydroxyvaleric acid, urea, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid and ribonic acid.

In the culture medium analysis techniques as described above, in the culture of pluripotent stem cells, their differentiation state can be evaluated by measuring a specific marker metabolite in a culture medium. As a technique of measuring the marker metabolite, a component separation method such as liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC) or capillary electrophoresis (CE) and a detection technique such as a mass spectrometer (MS) are generally combined for measurement. This technique, however, may bring an increase in size of the measuring device and a low degree of freedom of data acquisition.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION

Technical Problem

On the other hand, a method is known in which regression analysis is performed on an extracellular metabolite and its spectrum information to easily and rapidly quantify the extracellular metabolite optically. However, it has been revealed, through the present disclosers' review, that, in the determination of the undifferentiated state of pluripotent stem cells, the regression model using only teacher data obtained from a culture medium that keeps pluripotency provides low quantification of the metabolite that serves as an indicator of the differentiation state, and thus cannot be used in the determination. In particular, for example, when it is necessary to determine a large amount of a culture medium of pluripotent stem cells at one time, there is a strong demand for the development of an easy and rapid examination method.

Thus, the present disclosure provides novel method and device for easily, rapidly and accurately determining the undifferentiated state of pluripotent stem cells.

According to the present disclosure, the undifferentiated state of pluripotent stem cells can be determined easily, rapidly and accurately.

11952331	"BACKGROUND

1. Field

The disclosure of the present patent application relates to novel organoselenium selective ligands to determine metal ions in a sample.

2. Description of the Related Art

Many analytical techniques are available for the determination of metal ions in a sample. However, the direct determination of such metal ions is typically limited due to the lack of sensitivity and matrix interference. Therefore, a preconcentration step is usually required prior to the analysis.

Recently, there is a trend for environmentally friendly separation procedures that use small amounts of organic solvents and agree with Green Chemistry Principles. Such procedures usually involve the chelation of metal ions by a suitable ligand to form a hydrophobic complex that is able to extract quantitatively in a micro-volume of the extracting solvent.

In general, not only natural amino acids but any organic acids bearing amino and/or hydroxy groups, preferably with these substituents in the alpha or beta position relative to the carboxyl unit, are generally suitable for preparing these metal chelates. However, preference is given to using the naturally occurring amino acids alanine, arginine (basic), asparaginne, aspartic acid (acidic), cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid (acidic), glycine, histidine (basic), isoleucine, leucine, lysine (basic), methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine.

A suitable method for preparing such compounds, which are widely used, for example as additives in the human sector and in animal nutrition, is of great general interest. The chelate stability should not have an adverse effect on the bioavailability of the amino acid or hydroxycarboxylic acid. Many amino acid chelates even increase the bioavailability of the central cation coadministered compared to a salt or oxide of this cation.

According to the present-day state of the art, the production of suitable metal chelates as organic trace element compounds is mainly carried out with only low energy efficiency by wet chemical means or else by likewise energy-intensive mechanical processes with participation of milling media, especially in ball mills, within the latter case about 90% of the energy supplied being merely converted into heat (see EP 2489670 A1). The known wet-chemical processes are burdened by, in particular, the unavoidably energy-inefficient and correspondingly costly drying of the material; in addition, the product is not free of foreign inorganic anions.

Solvent-free processes, inter alia, are also known from the prior art (Rummel, U.S. Pat. No. 2,877,253 (A), 1959; Ashmead, Pedersen, U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,424 (B1), 2002; Pedersen, Ashmead, U.S. Pat. No. 6,518,240 (B1), 2003). Although solvent-free processes do not per se have the abovementioned disadvantage that large amounts of the solvent, normally water, must be removed, they do however require additional amounts of energy when product formation occurs in mechanical mills containing milling media, especially in ball mills. The reason for the increased energy consumption is that milling media must be set in motion as additional masses, for example in the process described by D. Ramhold, E. Gock, E. Mathies, W. Strauch, EP 2489670 (A1), 2012, in an excentric vibratory mill (EVM). When excentric vibratory mills are used, the energy consumption for driving the counterweight is additional. Furthermore, in such an inhomogeneously operating vibratory mill system, comparatively high wear is observed as a result of the high impact stresses on the milling media themselves. The abraded material is then undesirably found in the product.

In addition, the drying of material mentioned at the outset also becomes relevant in the last-named processes since water of reaction formed in this type of reaction milling has to be removed again under action of heat and/or with reduction of the pressure, with additional energy consumption.

A further disadvantage of the abovementioned solid-state processes for producing metal chelates is the sometimes considerable size heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity of the solid products obtained. Thus, for example, the process described in EP 2 489 670 A1 produces acicular metal-amino acid chelate structures having an average particle size of from 40 to 60 m, with up to 80% of the particles having a particle size from >0 to 100 μm and up to 2% have a particle size of more than 500 μm, i.e. a value which is a factor of 10 higher than the “average size” of 50 μm, thus with a considerable amount of oversize particles.

A great structural heterogeneity quite generally increases the difficulty of further processing of the metal chelate complexes obtained, for example classification according to particle size, precise metering and homogeneous mixing with further substances. The active compound release kinetics are also unfavorably influenced by the particle size heterogeneity. A greatly acicular morphology hinders the flowability and scatterability of the particulate product. Acicular crystals of the complexes with are not readily water-soluble and sometimes even acid-insoluble can be hazardous to health when absorbed in the human or animal body.

Acicular structures are therefore to be avoided.

Thus, new metal chelating complexes solving the aforementioned problems are desired.

11970943	"BACKGROUND

In the oil and gas industry, hydrocarbons are located in porous formations far beneath the Earth's surface. Wells are drilled into these formations to access and produce said hydrocarbons. A well is a structure formed by a wellbore and supported by at least one casing string cemented in the wellbore. A casing string is made of a plurality of joints of casing connected together. The primary concern while drilling a well is well control, that is, preventing an uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons to the Earth's surface.

As such, casing strings often have at least one float valve installed in the float shoe or the float collar of the casing string. The float valve is a check valve that only allows a flow of fluid in one direction. In terms of the casing string and the wellbore, the float valve only allows the flow of fluid from the inside of the casing string to the wellbore. The wellbore is filled with a drilling fluid prior to the casing string being run into the wellbore, thus the casing string must overcome a buoyant force in order to be lowered to the bottom of the wellbore.

Because the bottom of the casing string is blocked with the float valve, fluid is unable to enter the casing string from the wellbore, as such, the casing string is often filled with fluid from the surface to weight up the casing string and aid in overcoming the buoyant force. However, due to the float valve allowing fluid to migrate from the inside of the casing string to the wellbore, the fluid entering the casing string from the surface will exit out the bottom of the casing string to the wellbore. This prevents the casing string from being completely filled with the fluid which, in turn, makes it difficult to overcome the buoyancy force and run the casing string to the bottom of the wellbore.

SUMMARY

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In general, one or more embodiments relate to systems and methods for placing a fluid in an annulus of a well.

The disk is fixed above the float valve and within the conduit of the tubular body. The disk is configured to prevent flow in the second direction until the disk is broken by a pre-determined force. The stinger is deployed in the casing string by a deployment device and has a bottom end with an outer diameter smaller than a diameter of the conduit. The stinger applies the pre-determined force to the disk to allow a flow of the fluid, in the second direction, from the stinger to the annulus.

Described herein are apparatuses for treating neurological disorders by electric stimulation, in particular adaptive electric stimulation, and methods for processing neural signals acquired by an electric stimulation apparatus during the delivery of stimulation pulses. The methods described herein comprise suppressing stimulation artifacts in the acquired neural signals in order to extract neural activity data.

BACKGROUND

Deep brain stimulation, also known by the acronym DBS, is a therapeutic method that electrically modulates the activity of neuronal structures of the central nervous system. One or more DBS electrodes are implanted by neurosurgery into a patient's brain to deliver electrical stimulation to neurons in the brain area(s) surrounding the electrodes. Electric stimulation consists of generating a train of electrical pulses using a pulse generator and transmitting these pulses to the one or more implanted electrodes, which deliver these pulses to a brain area of interest. In some cases, electrical pulses have relatively high-frequency (>100 Hz), biphasic waveforms, having a cathodic phase followed by an anodic phase. The overall charge injected in the two phases is forced to be nil to avoid tissue damage. In conventional DBS systems, stimulation parameters such as amplitude, frequency and pulse width are constant over the time and can only be adjusted by a clinician during a scheduled clinic visit.

DBS is currently used for the treatment of multiple diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Such a method allows the functional autonomy of patients to be improved, thus offering a better quality of life. However, some patients still suffer from adverse motor symptoms and suboptimal control of clinical fluctuations. Such DBS related issues may be mitigated by adjusting stimulation parameters. For instance, the adjustment of stimulation parameters can avoid motor symptoms induced by DBS (Bronstein et al., 2011) stimulation-induced hemiballism (Limousin et al., 1996), motor side effects such as dyskinesia (Hamani et al., 2005), speech and gait impairment (Bronstein et al., 2011). Moreover, it has been observed in a long-term follow-up study that the greater the number of follow-up visits for DBS parameter adjustment, the more promising the DBS clinical outcomes (Moro et al., 2006).

The recent research and technological innovations in the field of neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and neural engineering provided new opportunities to explore the Parkinson's disease pathophysiology and DBS mechanisms. With these developments, the idea of a DBS system which can adapt stimulation parameters over time in relation to symptom fluctuations and adverse effects, achieved a high interest (Burgess et al., 2010, Rosin et al., 2011, Santaniello et al., 2011) and has been generally referred to as Adaptive DBS or Closed-loop DBS.

A closed-loop paradigm adapts stimulation parameters based on a control variable that may represent the patient's clinical state and its symptoms. U.S. Pat. No. 7,277,758 describes an apparatus for treating neurological disorders which is configured to adapt the stimulation parameters to the clinical state of the patient by recording a physiological marker, also known as biomarker, as a control variable. Other approaches have been proposed in the literature based on different control variables: neurochemical signals (Chang S Y et al., 2013), single and multi-unit activity based on micro-electrode arrays (Rosin et al., 2011), electrocorticography (Hemptinne et al., 2015), surface electroencephalography, surface electromyography and accelerometers.

Adaptive DBS techniques may use the low-frequency oscillatory components of the electrical activity of the neuronal population around the electrode, known as local field potentials (LFPs), as a control variable for adjusting stimulation parameters. LFPs have been found, in some circumstances, to correlate with the patient clinical state (Priori et al., 2004, Eusebio et al., 2011, Kuhn et al., 2009). Some DBS systems may be able to record LFPs using the electrodes that are also used for stimulation. The amplitude of LFPs may contain information representing the state of a specific brain region. For example, in Parkinson's disease, excessive synchronization of the basal ganglia network in the beta frequency band (12-35 Hz) has been linked to motor impairments (Kuhn et al., 2009). The power value of the beta band has been therefore proposed as control variable for adaptive DBS (Priori et al., 2013).

LFPs recorded from DBS electrodes are low-amplitude signals in the microvolt range (Yoshida et al., 2012) having frequencies of interest as low as 1 Hz. Especially in implantable devices, the development of recording systems that are able to both measure these low-amplitude, low-frequency signals while delivering electrical stimulation can be difficult because of the restricted power and space budget that generally impacts on the noise performance. To achieve appropriate space and power dimensioning, the recording circuits of the prior art have been developed as application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) implemented using low voltage CMOS circuitry. More specifically, prior art recording circuits make use of operational amplifiers with MOS input transistors. This implies a limit in their downscaling due to the several non-ideal effects (e.g., 1/f noise, thermal noise, DC offset) inherent in size reduction of device technology operating at low voltages.

A solution for an analog front-end that may handle input noise while satisfying size and power consumption criteria for an implantable device has been proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,847,628, which describes a chopper amplifier for modulating the target signal to higher frequency where the 1/f flicker noise is negligible. The “chopper stabilization technique” used in U.S. Pat. No. 7,847,628 for removing the non-ideal effects of operational amplifiers consists in modulating the input signal to very high frequencies (i.e., with respect to the signal frequency content) upstream from the amplifier. In this way, the flicker noise generated by the amplifier is not superimposed to the input signal. Downstream of amplification, the input signal is modulated back to its original frequency band with a suitable amplitude to dominate over the 1/f noise. This noise can be further reduced by low pass filtering.

However, concurrently recording LFPs and delivering stimulation may introduce an additional technical problem with respect to 1/f noise filtering. Sensing LFPs with concurrent stimulation is a desirable feature in adaptive DBS. Concurrently stimulating the brain region while recording LFP data may be used to track LFP power modulation over time and confirm or measure the efficacy of the stimulation.

The problem of recording local field potentials during deep brain stimulation consists in sensing a neural signal having an amplitude lower than 1 μV with a concurrent electric stimulus artifact in the order of tens of millivolts. The electric stimulus artifact is a voltage difference produced by the stimulating signal between two imperfectly matched recording electrodes. In order to be able to detect such low amplitude/low frequency neural signals, high gain amplification is desired. However, due to the presence of the stimulus artifact, high gain amplification can lead to the saturation of the recording chain. Since the stimulus artifact is included in the input signal from the beginning, i.e. before any modulations can take place, the chopper stabilization technique described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,847,628 reveals to be inappropriate to reduce the stimulus artifact. Moreover, moving the stimulus signal to the high frequencies may additionally introduce the problem that the high frequency components of the stimulus artifact interact with the “chop” harmonics.

To mitigate the problem of the stimulus artifact, Stanslanski et al. 2011 describe a solution making use of a first stage implemented as the analog front-end described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,847,628 followed by a second stage comprising a conventional low-pass filter (U.S. Pat. No. 9,888,861, Stanslanski et al., 2011). However, after low pass filtering, the signal still suffers of residual stimulation interferences, namely residual interferences due to the stimulus artifact, as described in detail below.

A different solution approach to this problem provides for a system comprising a low-gain differential stage followed by a low-pass filter and a final amplification stage. Keeping the differential gain low may help to avoid saturation and may facilitate amplification of the neural signal above the input referred noise of the low-pass filter. After low-pass filtering, the stimulation frequency components are significantly reduced or eliminated. This allows for the introduction of a single-ended stage to increase the gain without saturation and to adjust the signal amplitude to the A/D converter dynamic range. A low-pass passive network before the differential stage may be introduced to further suppress the artifact before the first amplifier, if required by its gain/input dynamic range performance.

Although this solution has proven to be effective in recording LFPs during stimulation, some residual stimulation interference still persisted after low-pass filtering. Residual stimulation interference may occur in the form of an unwanted increase of the total power (signal included) as shown inFIG.9aand/or spurious artifact tones in the band of interest for LFP recording (<40 Hz). Despite these residual stimulation interferences have been observed, their causes have not been determined yet. One attempt to manage the problem of reducing or eliminating such residual stimulation interference provided for normalization of the spectral content of the filtered neural signal by its total power. The main drawback of this method is that it can introduce a bias whenever physiological power spectral changes occur outside the observed frequency band. For instance, an increase of power in a frequency band different from the one chosen as control variable (i.e., beta band) may lead to an underestimation of the useful signal.

In alternative, Stanslanski and colleagues used a support vector machine (SVM) logic to introduce a linear separation between the same signals recorded with and without stimulation (U.S. Pat. No. 9,888,861, Stanslanski et al., 2011). The basic assumption of this method is that the effect of the stimulation on the band power is linear. However, even if the assumption is correct, SVM logic typically requires a large amount of patient-specific data to train the network and, moreover, it is not suitable for algorithms requiring a continuous changing of the stimulation parameters.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Applicant contemplated the problem of overcoming the above-mentioned drawbacks, and, in particular, of eliminating or substantially reducing the residual stimulation interferences affecting the neural signal after low-pass filtering in an apparatus for treating neurological disorders.

Within the scope of the above problem, the Applicant considered the objective of allowing reliable sensing with concurrent stimulation in an apparatus for treating neurological disorders providing adaptive electrical stimulation.

Therefore, the technical problem consists in devising apparatuses and methods for processing the neural signal capable of recording LFPs during stimulation by suppressing the stimulation artifact and reducing or eliminating residual stimulation interference (e.g., unwanted increase of the total power and/or spurious artifact tones in the low frequencies (<40 Hz)) that may affect the neural signal, thereby providing reliable and accurate acquisition of neural signal data for adapting the electrical stimulation with an architecture suitable for an implantable system and for industrial manufacturing process reliability (i.e. optimized in terms of space and power consumption).

One variation of an apparatus for treating neurological disorders may comprise at least one electrode implantable in the brain of a patient, and a processing and stimulation device connected to the at least one electrode. The processing and stimulation device at least comprises a stimulation module configured to generate a stimulation signal to be sent to the at least one electrode, and an acquisition module configured to acquire local field potentials (LFPs) characteristic of cerebral activity (e.g., neural signal) measured by the electrode from the brain of the patient. The acquisition module at least comprises a front-end block configured to amplify the potential difference of its input signals (V1a, V2a) and to filter a stimulus artifact by cutting off frequencies above a predefined frequency band, characterized in that the front-end block comprises a multi-stage fully-differential switched capacitor circuit (e.g., an integrated circuit) configured for discrete-time signal processing.

For the first time, based on mathematical simulation and in vitro testing, Applicant was able to determine the genesis of the above discussed residual stimulation interferences. Applicant realized that the real stimulus signal is not an ideal periodic monophasic/biphasic square wave with only high frequency components, but it carries additional noise even in the low frequencies (i.e. having frequency components that overlap with the frequency spectrum of LFPs). This additional noise in the low frequencies may be converted into a differential artifact by imbalances on the recording electrodes and by the finite common mode rejection of the acquisition system.

Moreover, Applicant observed that the finite common mode rejection of the acquisition system causes the conversion of the common mode noise, superimposed onto the stimulus signal, into a differential form, thus being amplified and acquired. Accordingly, Applicant identified the importance of optimizing the common mode rejection of the multi-stage front-end.

Described herein are variations of LFP acquisition modules (i.e., electrical circuitry) that allow reliable LFP signal sensing with concurrent stimulation in an apparatus for electrical deep brain stimulation. One variation of an acquisition module may comprise a high-order low pass filter (i.e., corner frequency <100 Hz) that reduces or eliminates residual stimulation interference, facilitates common mode rejection, and is operable under the size and power consumption constraints of an implantable device. An acquisition module may comprise a switched-capacitor based, fully-differential, multi-stage architecture that is configured to process a discrete signal.

Applicant has identified that the use of a fully-differential architecture based on switched capacitors technology may provide good common mode rejection and makes possible the implementation of a very low-frequency filter corner, while satisfying the size constraints of an implantable device.

The fully-differential circuit architectures comprising switched capacitor technology described herein may be configured to use discrete-time processing methods to help mitigate the 1/f noise and DC offset without impacting (e.g., increasing) the circuit size.

Also described herein is a method for processing neural signals collected by an apparatus for treating neurological disorders or DBS system. In one variation, the method may comprise amplifying and pre-filtering the neural signal using a first stage comprising a fully-differential switched capacitor circuit (e.g., an integrated circuit) configured for discrete-time signal processing, and filtering the amplified and pre-filtered signal by cutting off signals above a predetermined frequency band using a second stage comprising a fully-differential switched capacitor circuit (e.g., an integrated circuit) configured for discrete-time signal processing. Preferably, at least one of the step of amplifying and pre-filtering the neural signal and the step of filtering the amplified and pre-filtered signal comprises correlated double sampling (CDS). Optionally, the step of amplifying and pre-filtering the neural signal may comprise amplifying the neural signal to a value greater than an input-referred noise of the second stage.

Advantageously, the method for processing neural signals described herein achieves the technical effects described above with regard to the apparatus for treating neurological disorders.

While some variations may comprise at least one of the above aspects and/or may have at least one of the following preferred features, any of the features described herein may be combined with each other as desired to meet specific implementation purposes.

In one variation of an apparatus described herein, a multi-stage front-end block may comprise a pre-filter stage and a suppression filter stage positioned downstream from the pre-filter stage. The acquisition module may comprise an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter block that may be in downstream communication with the front-end block. In some variations, the front-end block may comprise a two-stage, fully-differential switched capacitor circuit configured for discrete-time signal processing in order to maximize the common mode rejection ratio of the acquisition system. Accordingly, the differential signal may be transmitted in its discrete-time form from the front-end block to the A/D converter, which converts the analog input signal into a digital output signal.

In some variations, the pre-filter stage of the front-end block may comprise a fully-differential low-pass switched capacitor filter, clocked at a first clock frequency. Accordingly, the step of amplifying and pre-filtering the neural signal may be performed using the first fully-differential switched capacitor filter, clocked at the first clock frequency. Advantageously, the pre-filter stage provides amplification while filtering out high-frequency components of the signal that can cause aliasing effects, i.e., the pre-filter stage may be configured to perform an antialiasing function.

In some variations, the suppression filter stage of the front-end block may comprise a fully-differential low-pass switched capacitor filter, clocked at a second clock frequency. The first clock frequency of the pre-filter stage may be greater than the second clock frequency of the suppression filter stage. In some variations, the first clock frequency may be about 1 KHz or more. The second clock frequency may be less than half of the first clock frequency.

Preferably, the pre-filter stage may comprise a filter having an order lower than an order of the filter of the suppression filter stage. In some variations, the filter of the suppression filter stage may have an order of at least three or more. The pre-filter stage may comprise a low pass filter having a first cut-off frequency in the range between the minimum stimulation frequency (e.g., about 50-250 Hz), and the second clock frequency. For example, the first cut off frequency may be greater than about 50 Hz.

In some variations, the suppression filter stage may comprise a filter having a second cut-off frequency in the range between the maximum frequency component of the neural signal (e.g., about 35-40 Hz) and the frequency of the stimulus artifact (e.g., about 50-250 Hz). Accordingly, the step of filtering the amplified and pre-filtered signal may be performed using the second fully-differential switched capacitor filter, clocked at the second clock frequency. The first cut-off frequency of the pre-filter stage is preferably greater than the second cut-off frequency of the suppression filter stage.

Preferably, the second cut-off frequency is in the range of about 35-250 Hz.

Distributing the functionalities among at least two stages (e.g. the anti-aliasing filtering to the pre-filter and the stimulation artifact rejection to the suppression filter), allows to achieve an optimal trade-off between performances and size/complexity of the circuit.

In some variations, a fully-differential switched capacitor pre-filter stage and/or a suppression filter stage may be implemented as ladder filters employing switched capacitor integrators in an active emulation of a lossless LC ladder structure.

In detail, the fully-differential switched capacitor filter stages (pre-filter and/or suppression filter) may be implemented using CMOS technology. Advantageously, these filter architectures may achieve a very precise response, featuring very low sensitivity to spreads in component values, and a wide dynamic range while requiring small chip area, low-power consumption, and relatively low-performance operational amplifiers.

In a preferred embodiment, the fully-differential switched capacitor pre-filter and/or suppression filter comprises basic building units having fully-differential bilinear switched capacitor integrators. Advantageously, the pre-filter and/or suppression filters that comprise fully-differential bilinear switched capacitor integrators may help increase the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) at the frequencies of interest (i.e. at the frequencies of a recorded neural signal and/or any neural activity signal, for example, in the range of about 1 Hz to about 40 Hz, e.g., from about 1 Hz to about 35 Hz).

In some variations, basic building units may comprise two inputs which are alternatively connectable to one end of two input capacitors, the other end of the two input capacitors being configured to alternatively connect to a reference voltage source or, each respectively, to one of two inputs of an amplifier, each input of the operational amplifier being connectable to one respective output of the operational amplifier through interposition of a first and a second feedback capacitor, respectively. This circuit arrangement may help to further increase the CMRR and facilitate the reduction and/or elimination of noise (e.g., from the stimulation artifact and/or 1/f noise) to extract neural signals of interest (e.g., neural activity data).

In some variations, the basic building units may be configured to implement a correlated double sampling (CDS) technique.

In some variations, the basic building units may optionally comprise a third and a fourth feedback capacitor connected in parallel to the first and second feedback capacitors, respectively.

In some variations, the first and/or the second clock signal may be configured to time the alternative connection and disconnection of the third and fourth feedback capacitors to the input signal of the amplifier.

The timing of the connections between the input signal and the input capacitors, the input capacitors and the inputs of the amplifier, the feedback capacitors and the amplifier, may be controlled by the first and/or second clock signal with a specific phase for each connection stage for implementing the correlated double sampling (CDS) technique.

The connection between the input signal and the input capacitors and the connection between the feedback capacitors, may be controlled by first clock signals that are respectively in opposition of 180°. The connection between the input capacitors and the input of the amplifier are controlled by second clock signals that are delayed compared to the first clock signals and respectively in opposition of 180°.

Advantageously, the correlated double sampling (CDS) technique reduces noise density at low frequency and is thus particularly suitable for very low frequency applications of switched capacitor filters, wherein the dominant noise is the 1/f noise component of the operational amplifier. The CDS technique allows to implement a very compact pre-filter stage still effectively removing the nonideal 1/f noise. In fact, switched capacitors circuits allow to implement the CDS technique by adding switches.

In some variations, the output of the suppression filter stage may be fed differentially to the A/D converter. Accordingly, in some variations, the acquisition module further comprises an A/D converter block connected downstream from the front-end block. The A/D converter block may preferably comprise a delta-sigma converter.

In some variations, the A/D converter block may comprise a fully-differential switched-capacitor circuit (e.g., an integrated circuit).

In some variations, the A/D converter comprises a first sampling stage, followed by a filter stage configured for removing the quantization noise, and a decimation stage.

In some variations, the stimulation device may further comprise a control module configured for implementing an adaptive control of the stimulation module based on the signal acquired by the acquisition module.

In some variations, the acquisition module may optionally comprise a functional module upstream from the front-end configured to receive an input synchronization signal from the stimulation module for disconnecting or grounding the inputs of the front-end block during stimulus pulses generated by the stimulation module.

To facilitate sensing during stimulation, this functional module disconnects or grounds the inputs of the subsequent processing module during each stimulation pulse coming from the acquisition chain. Disconnecting or grounding the inputs during each stimulus and re-connecting them to the recording system after each stimulation pulse provides for an additional suppression/mitigation of the stimulus artifact, thus unburdening the attenuation requirements at the level of the second suppression filter stage.

In some variations, the acquisition module may further comprise a second functional module configured to suppress high frequencies in a signal produced by the operation of the first functional module.

In some variations, the acquisition module may also comprise a third functional module configured to provide high-pass filtering so as to mitigate offset potentials at least at one electrode (e.g. common mode and DC differential potentials), e.g., produced by the differences in the interface electro-chemical balances.

In some variations, the stimulation device may comprise a control module configured to implement an adaptive control of the stimulation module based on the signal acquired by the acquisition module. The control module may advantageously utilize the acquired neural signal to determine the feedback of parameters of the stimulation signal in order to adapt the therapy to patient neural activity data, which may represent a patient symptomatic state.

In some variations, the stimulation device may comprise at least one electro-catheter implantable in the brain of a patient and the at least one electrode may be located on the at least one electro-catheter. The at least one electro-catheter may comprise at least three electrodes, wherein at least two electrodes act as sensors that are configured to acquire neural signals in a patient brain region and to send the acquired neural signals to the acquisition module, and at least one electrode receives a stimulating signal from the stimulation module to deliver electrical stimulation to the patient brain region.

BACKGROUND

1. Field

The present disclosure relates to the field of communication networks and more particularly to optimizing computation of log-likelihood ratio (LLR) for decoding modulated symbols at a receiver in a communication network.

2. Description of Related Art

To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of 4G communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved 5G or pre-5G communication system. Therefore, the 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a ‘Beyond 4G Network’ or a ‘Post LTE System’.

The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), Full Dimensional MEMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G communication systems.

In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud Radio Access Networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, Coordinated Multi-Points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like.

In the 5G system, Hybrid FSK and QAM Modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SOMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.

Generally, in a communication system, a transmitter encodes data to obtain code bits for the data and maps the obtained code bits to modulation symbols using a suitable modulation scheme. The transmitter further generates the modulated signal by processing the modulated symbols and transmits the generated modulated signal to a receiver over a communication channel.

The receiver receives the transmitted signal and processes the received signal to obtain the modulated symbols, which have been sent by the transmitter. The receiver computes log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for the code bits based on the received modulated symbols. The LLRs are indicative of a confidence in zero (‘0’) or one (‘1’) being sent for each code bit. For a given code bit, a positive LLR value may indicate more confidence in ‘0’ being sent for the code bit, a negative LLR value may indicate more confidence in ‘1’ being sent for the code bit, and an LLR value of zero may indicate equal likelihood of ‘0’ or ‘1’ being sent for the code bit. The receiver may then decode the LLRs to obtain the decoded data that has been transmitted by the transmitter.

In conventional approaches, the receiver may use at least one of a hard decoding and a soft decoding for computing the LLR. The hard decoding may be used to compute the LLR without any complexity, but it degrades an error performance. The soft decoding may achieve better error performance, but at a cost of significant increase in complexity. The soft decoding may involve expressions for computing the LLR. For example, the expressions may correspond to the operations such as, but not limited to, square, square-root, division, absolute, multiplication, adders, and so on. However, such operations may be expensive and may increase the complexity involved in the soft decoding: In order to reduce the complexity involved in the soft decoding, several approximations may be used. However, the approximations either suffer from a loss in the error performance or involve a sizeable amount of computation.

SUMMARY

This present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for decoding modulated symbols in a communication network.

Also, this present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for decoding a data in a wireless communication system.

Accordingly, the embodiments herein provide methods and systems for optimizing computation of log-likelihood ratio (LLR) for decoding modulated symbols at a receiver in a communication network.

The method includes computing a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of each bit in the received at least one symbol using a centroid method.

11897414	"BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a hinge system of a hood of a vehicle. The invention further relates to a vehicle comprising a hood which has a hinge system of this kind.

Hood hinges for vehicles are known from the prior art. For example, DE 10 2015 203 516 A1 or DE 10 2015 203 513 A1 disclose hinge mechanisms of this kind.

In order to guarantee pedestrian protection, hinge systems of this kind which are known in the art offer the possibility of lifting the hood by a certain amount, even when it is in the locked state, so that a distance between the hood and the components lying thereunder is increased. In this way, the hood can be deformed by the head of a passenger, for example, without this deformation being affected by components lying beneath the hood.

Four-bar kinematics are customarily used in hinge systems known in the art. This means that a hinge upper part and a hinge lower part are coupled by two links which allow a pivoting movement and a lifting movement between the hinge upper part and the hinge lower part. In addition, there is a further pivot point in the hinge upper part which, however, is locked by a locking system. If the hood has to be lifted due to a crash, this pivot point is released, as a result of which the hinge system allows the hood to be lifted even in the locked state. The hinge upper part has a two-part design for this purpose, wherein the hood is lifted by a scissor-like opening of the two parts of the hinge upper part.

With hinge systems of this kind which are particularly known from the previously described documents, there is the risk of a substantial excessive rise in an upswung state of the hood. This means that the hood overswings during the lift-up process and therefore exhibits a maximum height which is up to 100% above the height that should actually be achieved.

The problem addressed by the present invention is that of providing a hinge system of a hood of a vehicle which, through simple and cost-effective production and assembly, limits an overswing of the hood.

The problem is solved by the features of the independent claim. The dependent claims contain preferred developments of the invention.

The problem is therefore solved by a hinge system of a hood of a vehicle. The hood of the vehicle is, in particular, an engine hood of the vehicle. The hood may, in particular, be locked to the vehicle, wherein if this lock is released, the hinge system can open the hood. However, the hinge system allows a lifting of the hood even in the event that the hood is locked. The hinge system particularly comprises a hinge for this purpose which is arranged between the hood and a counter-element of the vehicle. The hinge is designed both for opening the hood and for lifting the hood in the closed state.

Moreover, the hinge system has a lifting-piston actuator. By means of the lifting-piston actuator, an opening force for lifting the hood can be advantageously applied to the hinge upper part. Consequently, a lifting movement of the hood can be introduced by the lifting-piston actuator. For this purpose, the lifting-piston actuator has a piston element. In particular, the lifting-piston actuator is driven by a propellant, so that the hood experiences powerful acceleration. In the prior art, this results in the previously described excessive rise due to an upswing. In order to avoid this kind of excessive rise and/or an upswing of this kind, the piston element can be connected to the hinge and/or to the hood in a form-fitting manner. In this way, the freedom of movement of the hood can be limited, particularly in the direction of the lifting movement. If the hood is an engine hood of the vehicle, a distance between assemblies in the engine compartment of the vehicle and the engine hood can be increased by lifting, so that pedestrian protection is improved. If the head of a passerby should impact against the hood of the vehicle representing an engine hood in a crash scenario, the deformability of the hood is improved due to the increased distance between the hood and the engine compartment assemblies. At the same time, an overswing of the hood is avoided. Particularly advantageously, the piston element of the lifting-piston actuator is separated from the hinge and/or the hood in a retracted position. In an at least partially extended state, the piston element can be connected to the hinge and/or the hood in a form-fitting manner. Consequently, a connection is made between the lifting-piston actuator and hinge and/or hood only during a movement of the piston element. In particular, there is no permanent, form-fitting connection between the piston element and hinge and/or hood, but instead the connection can only be made when the lifting-piston actuator moves the hood.

In particular, the hood has a spring element which keeps the hood in an open position during normal running. If the hood is closed, the aforementioned elastic element is advantageously located in an inoperative position, wherein the hood can be lifted by the lifting-piston actuator. By means of this lifting, the spring element of the hood is also moved out of the inoperative state, as a result of which the hood is preferably lifted on the one hand by the lifting-piston actuator and on the other hand by the spring element. The spring element is, in particular, a gas compression spring.

In order to prevent the hood from overswinging, the hinge advantageously has a strap element. In turn, the strap element has a holding region which is provided for the form-fitting connection to the piston element. The holding region can be advantageously moved by the hinge, in particular by an opening movement of the hinge, in a piston displacement of the piston element. Consequently, it is particularly advantageously provided that the lifting-piston actuator completes a lifting movement in order to initiate a lifting of the hood. The opening movement of the hinge then begins, as a result of which the strap element completes a characteristic opening movement. This opening movement particularly also comprises a movement of the strap element relative to the fixed piston element, so that the holding region can be displaced to the piston element. The opening movement of the hinge upper part moreover comprises a component through which the strap element is moved along the piston element, wherein this movement component is limited on account of the previously described form-fit between the piston element and holding region of the strap element. In this way, the entire opening movement of the hinge is limited, as a result of which an upswing of the hood can be minimized or prevented entirely.

The holding region is preferably part of a through-opening in the strap element, wherein the through-opening also comprises a through-region. It is preferably provided that the through-region of the strap element has a larger cross section than the holding region. The piston element of the lifting-piston actuator can be passed through the strap element at the through-region and cannot be passed through the strap element at the holding region. Consequently, it is particularly made possible for the piston element to be guided through the strap element at the through-region, wherein following a displacement of the piston element into the holding region, the strap element can no longer be separated from the piston element. It can thereby be achieved that the piston element serves to limit a movement of the strap element, and therefore of the hinge. The strap element exhibits, particularly on account of the through-region and the holding region, a keyhole-shaped contour which, on the one hand, allows the piston element to be passed through and, on the other hand, a blocking at the piston element. The piston element therefore also preferably has two different cross-sectional regions, so that once the piston element has been passed through the strap element, a displacement of the piston element into the holding region of the strap element is made possible.

As the holding region, the strap element may also have an elastically deformable region. In this case, it is provided that the piston element is moved through the elastically deformable region with elastic deformation of the elastically deformable region. This can be realized by spring-loaded hoods, for example. The elastically deformable region is particularly designed in such a manner that a backwards movement of the piston element through the elastically deformable region is prevented. Consequently, the piston element can ensure the form-fitting connection to the hinge and/or the hood. In this case, too, no displacement of the holding region to the piston element is required, since the piston element can move through the holding region and the holding region therefore only acts against the direction of movement of the piston element. Alternatively, or in addition, the piston element may also have an elastically deformable region. In particular, the piston element may have an elastically deformable flange region. Consequently, the piston element can move through the holding region of the strap element with elastic deformation, wherein a backwards movement of the lifting piston through the elastically deformable region is in turn prevented.

The piston element preferably has a flange-shaped region. The flange-shaped region is larger in size than the holding region of the strap element, but at the same time is smaller in size than the through-region of the flange element. In this way, it is made possible for the flange-shaped region to be guided through the through-region, but not through the holding region. If the piston element is displaced into the holding region after the flange-shaped region is guided through the through-region, the strap element is blocked at the flange-shaped region of the piston element. Consequently, a movability of the hinge upper part can be advantageously limited. The flange-shaped region of the piston element can also be advantageously provided when the holding region is not a region in the through-opening. In particular, the flange-shaped region can only rest against the holding region sectionally. Particularly advantageously, the holding region can be formed by an edge against which the piston element can be placed with the flange-shaped region. As previously described, it is particularly advantageously provided that the holding region, in particular the edge, can be moved in a piston displacement of the piston element.

Moreover, the hinge system advantageously has an elastic element. The elastic element is used for applying a force to the piston element in the direction of the holding region of the strap element. Alternatively or in addition, the elastic element is used to block the piston element in the holding region. In particular, the elastic element is a plate spring. The plate spring covers the through-region, so that the elastic element designed as a plate spring is deformed when the piston element of the lifting-piston actuator is guided through the through-region of the strap element. As soon as the strap element is displaced and the piston element moves into the holding region, the elastic element moves back into its original position and once again conceals the through-region. In this way, the piston element can no longer get back to the through-region, as a result of which a release of the strap element and piston element is prevented.

The hinge system preferably has a hinge upper part with a main link and a hood part. Two links are attached to the main link and these are moreover supported on the counter-element of the vehicle. Consequently, a four-bar mechanism is produced between the counter-element and the main link. This corresponds to known kinematics which are used in the prior art for hoods of vehicles. The hood part of the hinge upper part is used to fasten the hinge system to the hood. A fixing element is particularly provided in order to prevent a relative movement between the main link and the hood part.

Moreover, it is provided that the hood part is fastened to the main link so as to be rotatable at a bearing point and is connected to the main link in a non-rotatable manner by the fixing element. The fixing element can, in turn, be released by the lifting-piston actuator. Consequently, the fixing element can be released in order to allow torsion between the hood part and the main link about the bearing point. This means that in a normal operating state the main link and the upper part of the flap represent a unit which is not relatively movable. Consequently, the front flap can be opened with the help of the four-bar kinematics when the front flap is unlocked. If, on the other hand, the fixing element is released, the four-bar mechanism can lift the hood, since a compensating movement through relative rotation of the main link and the hood part about the bearing point is made possible. In this case, the hood remains unlocked.

It is preferably provided that the strap element is fastened to the hinge upper part, in particular to the main link of the hinge upper part. Consequently, it is made possible for a movement of the main link to be limited. In this way, a movement of the hinge upper part itself is, in particular, limited. This means that an upswing of the hood during the lifting action is limited.

The fixing element advantageously has a predetermined breaking point. The predetermined breaking point can be broken by the lifting-piston actuator. Alternatively or in addition, the fixing element has a latch device which can be actuated by the lifting-piston actuator. Consequently, it is achieved that during normal operation the fixing element fixedly connects the main link and the hood part, while this connection is released only in a crash scenario by the lifting-piston actuator.

The hood part is advantageously mounted in a slot in the main link by means of a holding element. In this way, a maximum torsion angle is defined between the main link and the hood part. This means that a limit on the movability of the main link also leads to a restriction on the movability of the hood part. In this way, a movability of the entire hinge upper part, i.e. of the main link and the hood part, is limited by the flap element.

The invention further relates to a vehicle. The vehicle comprises a hood, as previously described. The hood is, in particular, an engine hood which covers the vehicle's engine compartment. The hood can be actuated by a hinge system, as previously described. Consequently, on the one hand the hood can be opened in the traditional manner by the hinge system; on the other hand, the hood can be lifted by the hinge system, in order to improve pedestrian protection in a crash scenario. The hood can be lifted to a predefined protection height by virtue of the hinge system. The predefined protection height is, in particular, 60 mm above the closed state of the hood. During the lifting action, an overswing of the hood is limited to max. 25% above the predefined protection height. This is achieved by a corresponding design of the lifting-piston actuator and strap element.

Further details, features and advantages of the invention result from the following description and the figures.

12053293	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to breastfeeding volume measurement device and in particular to a device that incorporates a sensor that operably provides a flow measurement indicative of a volume of breast milk being produced.

BACKGROUND

Among breastfeeding mothers there is a need for accurate measurement of milk volume delivered to a baby; in the absence of this information many mothers turn to supplementation or give up breastfeeding completely due to concerns over the baby's nourishment.

There is significant prior art in this field. Devices which have been invented or produced may be classified into three main groups:1. Offline indirect. A measurement is derived without directly measuring flow or volume; the calculated volume is presented only after the feeding session has completed. The most significant method in this category is pre- and post-measurement of the baby's weight. This is the only method which seems to be currently endorsed by national health services, but studies have shown it to suffer from very poor accuracy levels.2. Real-time indirect. Again, a proxy measurement is used to derive delivered milk volume. In this case, though, the measurement may be relayed to the mother in real-time. There are a number of patent disclosures and products in this field, mostly centring around measurement of the mother's breast milk volume. Methods employed involve, e.g. Doppler flow, skin-conductivity, physical volume, etc. One method not involving breast measurement relies on an acoustic signature of the baby's swallow in order to derive volume. These methods tend to be extremely complex and instances which have entered the market as a product have omitted accuracy information and generally been poorly received due to reported inaccuracies.3. Real-time direct. This is where the milk flow is measured directly as it passes from mother to baby, with the corresponding volume information being presented in real-time to the mother. Typical embodiments comprise a breast cup with a sensor mounted in or beside a milk channel which then leads to an artificial teat. Many sensor types have been proposed such as piezoresistive force, thermal gradient, mechanical turbine/reciprocating piston devices. While these devices in some instances are likely more accurate than the previous types, they also suffer from the problem of separating the baby from the mother's breast. The physical bulk of the sensor, or the required channel length, in each case is such that this separation is necessary.

Relevant examples of devices for measuring milk volume during breastfeeding are mentioned in the following prior-art.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,887,507B2 to Tulsa discloses a device for breastfeeding which includes a nipple shield in which a milk duct is fabricated, and which is equipped with a temperature gradient sensor in the milk duct or a mechanical flow meter, plus sensors for monitoring other parameters such as temperature, viscosity, fat content, and chemicals presence.

US patent No. 2013073211 (A1) to Hershkovich discloses a breastfeeding device consisting of a nipple shield equipped with a microcontroller-based breast milk flow meter, with on-board dielectric detector plate means and a piezo-resistive force sensor mean.

JP patent No. 463440262 to Kaizen discloses a breastfeeding device measuring the volume of milk from the breast during a feeding session by the volume of milk present in a transparent pipe. It does not comprise any flow sensor in the nipple shield nor in the milk pipe.

US patent No. 20130096461A1 to Sella discloses an apparatus and method to determine and monitor the flow rates and volume of fluids excreted or secreted by the body. The sensor means includes thermistors and measures the flow rate of the fluid passing through a channel calculating the difference in resistance of the two thermistors. Sella's device includes a thermal flow meter sensor.

U.S. Pat. No. 8,521,272B2 to Yeda Research and Development Co Ltd discloses a device for monitoring breastfeeding by capacitance measurement, determining variations in electric capacitance of the breast during breastfeeding, and correlating the electric capacitance variations to an amount of milk consumed by the infant via electrodes placed on the breast.

EP patent No. 2388026A1 to Tritsch-Olian discloses a device to assist breastfeeding, which is applied on the mothers' breast and in which a flowmeter can be embedded to measure the amount of milk taken by the child. It consists of a nipple shield to which a milk reservoir is attached and connected to a milk pump. It does not give a measurement of the flow of milk directly given to the infant by the mother's breast, and the presence of a flowmeter is not detailed, but described in a generic manner.

WO patent No. WO2014087343A1 to Momilk discloses a device which evaluates the amount of milk left in the breast by measuring the impedance of breast tissue with electrodes placed directly on the breast, or embedded in a case or brassiere. This patent describes a volumetric indirect measurement method.

US patent No. 20100217148A1 to Inolact discloses a device monitoring the amount of fluid from an organ, milk from human breast included. It consists of electrodes to be placed on the breast for a volumetric evaluation of the same. The patent also describes the possibility to add acoustic sensors for the detection of baby's gulps.

U.S. Pat. No. 8,280,493B2 to Mamsense discloses a device monitoring the amount of milk secreted by the breast during breastfeeding by means of ultrasonic Doppler-effect transmitter probes on the breast for a volumetric evaluation of the same. This patent describes a volumetric indirect measurement method.

US patent No. 20150223755A1 to Digisense describes a device to give an estimation of the quantity of milk taken from a baby by an indirect method. It details the use of a system to be applied on a diaper and which includes an optical sensor to calculate the amount of food taken by the baby.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,607,965B1 to Frazier describes a device consisting of a pipe and a nipple shield, which allows the milk to flow directly from a mother's breast to an artificial nipple that is placed in the infant's mouth for feeding purposes. The device is intended to allow mothers to feed their babies without using pumps and without exposing themselves during breastfeeding. This device introduces a mechanical separation of the baby from the breast, and does not involve any sensor for flow measurement.

JP patent No. JPH0788112A to Etsuno-Hirose Electric describes a device measuring the amount of milk ingested during breastfeeding which is equipped with a microphone detecting when the baby sucks the breast. A connected CPU counts instead the number of times of suction to determine the amount of milk ingested. Ultrasonic sensors can be added to detect a change in movement when the infant sucks milk. This does not consider a direct measurement of milk flow.

US patent No. 20160235353A1 to Momsense-Nakar describes again a device monitoring the amount of milk provided during breastfeeding by means of a microphone to be placed on the infant throat to detect swallowing, and ear plugs to be worn by the mother. The described technology provides an indirect measurement of the amount of milk taken by the baby

US patent No. 20080264180A1 to Kimberly-Clark Worldwide Inc describes a device using an acoustic method to detect the amount of milk provided. It includes an audio sensor and a receiver to detect, discriminate and count the number of liquid swallows to determine the volume of fluid ingested.

U.S. Pat. No. 8,413,502B2 to Zemel describes a device for the measurement of infant feeding performance, which includes a body portion with an end for receiving the fluid from a reservoir, the other end connected to a feeding nipple, the cross-sectional area of the second end being larger than the one of the first end, and a conduit communicating with the first and second end in which is included a pressure sensor, the monitored pressure indicative of the fluid flow in the channel. The pressure sensor described in this application is based on the venturi-meter principle, since the flow will pass through a channel which first part has a narrower section respect to the ending part.

WO2011/117859 describes a lactation measurement device which uses first and second thermistors provided upstream and downstream relative to one another and with respect to a flow channel. The elements are mounted at the walls or side of the flow channel. One of the thermistors is heated above the expected temperature of the milk, the disclosure is to the use of a constant absolute temperature for the heated element, and the cooling effect of the milk gives a measurement which is indicative of milk volume

Despite these known approaches that fall within the broad category of “Real-time direct” measurement there continues to be a need for a system and methodology that will allow a measurement of milk volume without requiring bulky physical sensors and associated electronics.

SUMMARY

These and other problems are addressed in accordance with the present teaching by a device comprising a flexible nipple shield adapted to operably conform in shape with a nipple, the shield defining a flow-channel through which a volume of milk will operably pass from the nipple to a feeding baby, the device further comprising a flow sensor provided within the flow-channel in the nipple shield and in contact with the milk flow.

In one arrangement, the flow sensor comprises a member mounted in the flow channel and perpendicular to the direction of the milk flow. Upon this member is mounted a thermally sensitive resistive element which may be heated above the ambient flow temperature either by its own power source, self-heating, or by an external source. The movement of liquid over the element will have the effect of cooling the element which measurably changes the resistance of the element to allow a flow value to be derived. This method may be implemented to hold the current, voltage, or temperature of the element constant in regimes which are commonly termed constant current anemometry, CCA, constant voltage anemometry, CVA, and constant temperature anemometry, CTA, respectively, the latter being the most commonly used. In each case the change in resistance, the required compensation for this change, or the element power is measured by an electrical circuit and converted by means of an algebraic transformation to a flow measurement.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises two members mounted in the flow channel and perpendicular to the direction of the milk flow, both members having thermally sensitive resistive elements mounted or integrated therein. One member remains unheated and is thus capable of measuring ambient milk temperature, while the other is heated to a known temperature increase or delta above this ambient value. In accordance with this arrangement, which differs from the previous arrangement which used absolute temperature measurements, this technique uses a known temperature delta between the two sensors, thereby allowing accurate flow measurement in the presence of varying ambient flow temperature.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises two members mounted horizontally in the flow channel and parallel to the direction of the milk flow, the flow channel including a restriction with a larger section close to the nipple and a smaller section close to the baby's mouth, the first member of the sensor being placed in the larger section of the channel and the second member being placed in the smaller section. Each of the first and second members are configured to sense a pressure variation as induced by the fluid passing by each the members respectively, the pressure measurements as detected by each member then defining a differential pressure measurement which arises from Bernoulli's principle and provides an indication of the milk flow within the channel. This type of flow sensor is commonly referred to as a Venturi-meter.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises one member mounted with an angle ‘ϑ’ respect to the flow channel and to the direction of the milk flow, the member emitting a frequency towards the flow, and the same member detecting the signal reflected by the milk flow, the shifted frequency arising from the Doppler effect providing an indication of the velocity of the milk within the channel. A range of frequency sources can be used such as ultrasound, visible-light, and infra-red.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises a separate frequency source and a detector mounted with an angle ‘ϑ’ respect to the flow channel and to the direction of the milk flow, one member emitting a frequency towards the flow, and the other member detecting the signal reflected by the milk flow, the shifted frequency providing an indication of the velocity of the milk as the previous method.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises two members mounted horizontally in the flow channel and parallel to the direction of the milk flow, the first member emitting an electromagnetic or mechanical frequency towards the flow, the second member placed after the first in the direction of the flow and detecting the signal reflected by the opposite wall of the channel, the shifted phase of the signal arising from the time of flight through the milk flow and providing an indication of the velocity of the milk within the channel. In this arrangement, each member may also act as both emitter and detector to provide time-of-flight information in both the forward and reverse flow directions thus allowing for more accurate flow resolution.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises two couples of members with a know separation distance in the flow direction, mounted on the opposite sides of the flow channel, the couple of members on one side emitting an optical signal towards the flow and the couple of members on the opposite side detecting the optical signal. For each couple, the signal is interrupted or perturbed due to the passage of particles, bubbles or other means in the fluid stream, the time of flight of which provides an indication of the velocity of the milk within the channel.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises two members mounted on the opposite sides respect to the flow channel and to the direction of the milk flow, the first member emitting an electromagnetic or mechanical frequency towards the flow, the second member placed after the first in the direction of the flow and detecting the signal propagated by the milk flow, the time of flight between the two signals providing an indication of the velocity of the milk within the channel. In this arrangement, each member may also act as both emitter and detector to provide time-of-flight information in both the forward and reverse flow directions thus allowing for more accurate flow resolution.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises one or more couples of members mounted transverse to the flow channel and to the direction of the milk flow, the first member of each couple emitting a sonic or ultrasound signal towards the flow, the second member placed in front of the first member transverse to the flow channel and detecting the signal with a phase shift due to the time of flight through the milk flow, the shift of the detected ultrasound signal providing an indication of the velocity of the milk flow within the channel. In the case where more than one sensor couple is used, the combined signals may be resolved into a spatial cross-sectional image from which point flow and overall flow may be derived. This field is broadly referred to as tomography.

In another arrangement, the flow sensor comprises one member shaped with a high camber wing or hydrofoil profile mounted in the flow channel and respect to the direction of milk flow, the member anchored in the flow channel by means of a pivot placed at the trailing edge of the member, and kept in position via two flexible elements placed above and under the member, the flow rate being measured by the difference of elongation of the two flexible members respect to the resting condition, and sensed by strain gages on said members.

In accordance with the present teaching, such a device provides a real-time direct measurement of the milk volume being delivered to the baby while at the same time addresses separation issue problems associated with the prior art by minimising the physical size and flow-channel length of the sensor.

Accordingly, there is provided a device as detailed in the claims that follow.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention belongs to the technical field of analysis and detection, and particularly relates to a test system and a test method for a lip sticking force of tipping paper for cigarettes.

BACKGROUND

A cigarette filter is composed of three layers, namely, acetate fiber, plug wrap paper and tipping paper. The tipping paper, also known as tip paper for a cigarette, is used to wrap the filter and bond the filter to the end of the cigarette. The tipping paper is a kind of decorative paper obtained by printing and coating the tipping base paper and processing by other methods. It is often cork or opaque white, and has the effect of improving the appearance. The tipping paper is in direct contact with the lips of smokers. Generally, only paint or ink is used to be printed on the tipping paper. When the weather is dry and consumers smoke cigarettes, a small amount of saliva may wet the tipping paper, and dry slowly during smoking. The saliva protein remaining on the lips has a binding effect on the tipping paper, so that the tipping paper on the filter sticks to the skin of the lips, and even causes the lips to tear and bleed. After smoking, the filter cannot be spit out smoothly, which seriously affects the experience of cigarette consumers.

At present, there is no measurement of the lip sticking force of the tipping paper for the cigarettes in China and other countries. Various Chinese tobacco companies and manufacturers of auxiliary materials for cigarettes mostly use artificial sensory evaluation to determine whether the tipping paper for the cigarettes sticks to the lips. No relevant standards have been issued, resulting in a big difference between the test and the determining results. In order to standardize the quality of the auxiliary materials for cigarettes, increase the comfort of cigarette consumers, and reduce the use rate of the tipping paper for the cigarettes with the lip sticking force, it is necessary to accurately measure and determine the lip sticking force of the tipping paper for the cigarettes, and establish the corresponding objective screening test method and test equipment.

SUMMARY

The present invention is proposed to solve the above-mentioned problems.

The present invention provides a test system for a lip sticking force of tipping paper for cigarettes. The test system includes: an artificial lip and test equipment.

The artificial lip is a silica gel block or a 3M low-viscosity tape.

The test equipment includes: a friction meter testing platform, a force measuring sensor, a rigid rope, a pulley, a pulley bracket and a sample loading module.

The pulley is installed on the pulley bracket, and the rigid rope slides in the pulley. The rigid rope is L-shaped, one end of the rigid rope in the horizontal direction is connected to the force measuring sensor, and the other end of the rigid rope in the vertical direction is connected to the sample loading module.

The artificial lip is located directly below the sample loading module, and the artificial lip is in contact with the sample loading module at a test position.

A friction resistance test software is installed in the friction meter testing platform, the friction meter testing platform is communicatively connected to the force measuring sensor, and the friction meter testing platform controls movement of the rigid rope and records changes of a force on the rigid rope with time and/or position.

The friction resistance test software is commercial software having a MAP software full name of MAP4.exe and purchased by Thwing-Albert Company.

The artificial lip may be a silica gel block or a 3M low-viscosity tape.

Preferably, the test system may further include: artificial saliva. During a test, the artificial saliva may be sprayed on a test surface of the artificial lip. In order to simulate human conditions more accurately, the artificial saliva at 36-37 degrees Celsius can be used.

Preferably, the artificial saliva may contain sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium chloride, urea, glucose, mucin, amylase, acid phosphatase and lysozyme.

Preferably, the artificial saliva may contain 1.40 mmol/L of sodium chloride, 0.5 mmol/L of potassium chloride, 0.1 mmol/L of calcium chloride, 0.15 mmol/L of sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.025 mmol/L of magnesium chloride, 0.09 mmol/L of urea, 0.2 mmol/L of glucose, 2.7 mmol/L of bovine submandibular gland salivary mucin, 2.5 units/mL of amylase, 0.004 units/mL of acid phosphatase, and 0.7 units/mL of lysozyme.

Preferably, the artificial lip may be detachably installed on an artificial lip bracket, and a horizontal adjusting component may be arranged under the artificial lip bracket. A horizontal adjusting nut may be used as the horizontal adjusting component to ensure that the artificial lip is placed horizontally.

Preferably, both ends of the rigid rope may be connected to the force measuring sensor and the sample loading module through a movable connecting piece, respectively. A snap ring may be used as the movable connecting piece. The movable connecting piece used can balance the force, and ensure that the force of the rigid rope on the force measuring sensor and the sample loading module acts on the entire surface of the contact surface on average. The snap ring is optional for the movable connecting piece.

If the rigid rope and the sample loading module are directly connected to the movable connecting piece, when the rigid rope pulls the sample loading module away from the artificial lip, the sample loading module and the artificial lip may start to separate at a certain corner of the contact surface between the two, resulting in inaccurate mechanical test results and poor repeatability.

Preferably, the sample loading module may include a counterweight and an elastic pad, where the elastic pad is fixed at a lower end of the sample loading module.

A rubber pad or silica gel block is optional for the elastic pad, and a metal block is optional for the counterweight.

A second aspect of the present invention provides a test method for a lip sticking force of tipping paper for cigarettes, using the test system according to the first aspect to perform a test. The test method includes the following steps:attaching a to-be-tested tipping paper sample to a lower end of the sample loading module, then connecting the sample loading module to the rigid rope, and clearing a load force on the rigid rope at this time;placing the artificial lip directly below the sample loading module;controlling the sample loading module to descend by the friction meter testing platform, so that the artificial lip is in contact with the to-be-tested tipping paper sample with a contact area of 1.5 cm*1.5 cm; and after contact, controlling the rigid rope to pull the sample loading module away from the artificial lip until a moment of separation, and controlling movement of the rigid rope by the friction meter testing platform and recording a maximum force on the rigid rope during the test, where the force is recorded as the lip sticking force with a value of F, andclassifying a lip sticking force grade and lip sticking performance according to the value of the lip sticking force by a method including:when 0 N≤F<0.2 N, determining that a result of the lip sticking force grade is grade 0, and the lip sticking does not exist;when 0.2 N≤F<0.3 N, determining that the result of the lip sticking force grade is grade 1, and the lip sticking is mild;when 0.3 N≤F<0.5 N, determining that the result of the lip sticking force grade is grade 2, and the lip sticking is moderate;when 0.5 N≤F<0.6 N, determining that the result of the lip sticking force grade is grade 3, and the lip sticking is heavy; andwhen F≥0.6 N, determining that the result of the lip sticking force grade is grade 4, and the lip sticking is severe.

During the test, the maximum force on the rigid rope is a force at the moment of separation between the tipping paper and the artificial lip. At this time, the force is maximum, and called the lip sticking force.

Alternatively, during the test, the friction meter testing platform records changes of a force on the rigid rope with time and/or position, and naturally marks a peak value of the force, which is the lip sticking force.

As some tipping paper is punched, when a width of the tipping paper is cut to 1.5 cm, a punched area is avoided, and test results will be more accurate at this time.

Preferably, a running speed of the rigid rope may be controlled by the friction meter testing platform to be 40-60 mm/min, and a contact time of the artificial lip and the to-be-tested tipping paper sample may be 4-6 s.

More preferably, the running speed of the rigid rope may be controlled by the friction meter testing platform to be 50 mm/min, and the contact time of the artificial lip and the to-be-tested tipping paper sample may be 5-6 s.

Preferably, a method for attaching the to-be-tested tipping paper sample to the lower end of the sample loading module may include: attaching the to-be-tested tipping paper sample to a side of a counterweight of the sample loading module, so that a middle of the to-be-tested tipping paper completely fits with an elastic pad at the lower end of the sample loading module.

During the test, first, one side of the to-be-tested tipping paper sample is adhered to one side of the counterweight of the sample loading module, and then the to-be-tested tipping paper sample is manually tightened, so that the middle part completely fits with the elastic pad. Then, the other side of the to-be-tested tipping paper sample is adhered to the other side of the counterweight of the sample loading module. The reasons why an adhesive is not used at the contact between the to-be-tested tipping paper and the elastic pad are as follows: 1, The surface of the to-be-tested tipping paper is uneven after adhesion of the adhesive, resulting in an uneven contact surface during contact with the artificial lip, and affecting the test accuracy. 2, After the adhesive is adhered to the elastic pad, the weight changes greatly, which affects a mechanical test value. 3, If the adhesive is adhered to the elastic pad, it is inconvenient to replace the tipping paper for the cigarettes, each time it is not cleaned, the next test is affected, thereby affecting the test results.

Preferably, before the artificial lip is in contact with the to-be-tested tipping paper sample, artificial saliva may be sprayed on the artificial lip.

Preferably, a movable cover plate bracket may be designed with a drawer type process, and a movable cover plate may be loaded in the middle, which is convenient for disassembly and assembly of the artificial lip.

In the present invention, it is preferable to place the tipping paper for the cigarettes on a cutting board for cutting, and a width of the to-be-tested tipping paper sample after the cutting is equal to a width of the sample loading module of the test equipment. An upper surface area of an artificial lip sample block must also be consistent with a bottom area of the sample loading module. Gloves are worn during operation to avoid direct contact between hands and test samples.

The above technical solutions can be freely combined without contradiction.

The present invention has the following beneficial effects.

1. The present invention provides the test equipment and test method for the lip sticking force of the tipping paper for the cigarettes, which can objectively and accurately detect the lip sticking force of the tipping paper for the cigarettes, effectively avoid the fuzzy concepts of lip sticking feeling and lip injury obtained by means of traditional sensory evaluation, and avoid the defects of major influence of subjective factors, large differences in smoking results and harm to human health.

2. Through the normal running of the test equipment, the test sample is in full contact with the artificial lip to obtain the lip sticking force, which has good repeatability and good consistency with the artificial sensory evaluation, so the test accuracy is high. The test method is simple and feasible, and has certain advantages in material access, quality control, and product upgrades in the tobacco industry.

3. The method according to the present invention is fast, objective and efficient, is good in repeatability and simple in operation, greatly saves test costs, improves efficiency, and is easy to popularize and apply.

The present application claims the priority benefits of China application serial No. 202022456677.X, filed on Oct. 29, 2020. The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this specification.

BACKGROUND

Technical Field

The present application relates to the field of cross-country equipment, in particular to a vehicle rescue device, a rescue plate and a support plate.

Description of Related Art

A rescue plate is regular cross-country equipment for a vehicle, and when the vehicle is trapped in a muddy road section and cannot move forward, the rescue plate is used for assisting the vehicle in escaping. When in use, the rescue plate is padded under a driving wheel of a vehicle so as to increase the friction force of the driving wheel to enable the trapped driving wheel in escaping from the sunken ground.

Accordingly, the upper and lower end surfaces of the known rescue plate are provided with cleats or formed with a plurality of protrusions and recesses to provide a function of increasing the frictional force.

However, in practical use, when a vehicle has to cross over a sunken ground with a distance larger than the length of the rescue plate, a plurality of rescue plates usually have to be sequentially placed end to end to assist the vehicle in escaping, but in the practical use, due to poor continuity between the rescue plates, skidding phenomenon is likely to occur when wheels pass through the space between adjacent rescue plates, which increases the escaping difficulty, and prolongs the time required.

SUMMARY

The present application provides a vehicle rescue device, a rescue plate, and a support plate.

In a first aspect, the present application provides a vehicle rescue device, which adopts the following technical solutions.

A vehicle rescue device includes a first rescue plate and a second rescue plate. At least one end of the first rescue plate is provided with a first connecting portion, at least one end of the second rescue plate is provided with a second connecting portion, and the first connecting portion is detachably connected with the second connecting portion.

Preferably, the first connecting portion includes a connecting shaft connected to the first rescue plate, an axis direction of the connecting shaft extends along a width direction of the first rescue plate, the second connecting portion includes a connecting plate connected to the second rescue plate, the connecting plate is formed with a connecting groove through which the connecting shaft extends, one side of the connecting plate away from the second rescue plate is provided with an opening communicating with the connecting groove and having a width smaller than the diameter of the connecting groove, and the connecting shaft is detachably connected with the connecting plate.

By adopting the above technical solution, the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate can be connected by means of the connecting shaft and the connecting plate, and meanwhile, the overall length can be further increased by connecting the two first rescue plates at the two sides of the second rescue plate. Therefore, when it is necessary to assist vehicle in escaping from a continuous sunken ground or a deeper sunken ground, it is possible to choose to connect the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate to adapt to the application environment. Such a connecting manner can make the continuity of the vehicle rescue device better, and when the wheel passes through the joint of the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate, the skidding phenomenon does not easily occur. After the rescue plate is used, the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate can be detached again and conveniently stored, so that the storage space is saved. Meanwhile, by adopting the technical solution, the connecting shaft and the connecting groove are connected in a manner such that a hinged structure can be formed when the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate are connected, thereby avoiding rigid connection between the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate.

Preferably, the connecting plate includes limiting portions arranged on two sides of the opening of the connecting groove and extending along a direction away from the second rescue plate, and the first rescue plate is formed with a limiting groove through which the limiting portion extends.

By adopting the above technical solution, the limiting portion extends through the limiting groove, so that sliding of the connecting plate in the axis direction of the connecting shaft can be limited, and thereby the connecting strength of the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate is improved.

Preferably, an outer peripheral wall of the connecting shaft is provided with two access planes arranged in parallel, and a distance between the two access planes is less than or equal to the width of the opening.

By adopting the above technical solution, the access planes facilitate the connection between the connecting shaft and the connecting plate, reducing the difficulty for assembling them.

Preferably, an outer peripheral wall of the connecting shaft is formed with a relief groove in the axis direction of the connecting shaft, and the relief groove is arranged at the lower side of the connecting shaft.

By adopting the above technical solution, in the process of assisting the vehicle in escaping, the first rescue plate can make contact with the tires firstly, and then the first rescue plate can have the trend of moving downward relative to the second rescue plate. At this time, the pressure between the lower end surface of the connecting shaft and the connecting plate can be increased, thereby increasing the pressure borne by the joint of the connecting shaft and the first rescue plate. The relief groove is arranged such that portions on the two sides of the relief groove can approach each other under the guidance of arc guide surface on the outer side of the connecting shaft. When the tire is disengaged from the first rescue plate, the connecting shaft will restore to the original state, so that the connecting shaft can have a certain elasticity in the downward pressing process, thereby absorbing part of the energy and improving the overall connection strength.

Preferably, the first rescue plate includes a fixing plate to which a connecting shaft is connected, and the fixing plate is inclined upward in an extension direction away from the connecting shaft.

By adopting the above technical solution, when the joint of the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate is pressed, when the joint of the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate is pressed, the two sides of the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate away from each other are raised upward. Such an arrangement allows a vacancy to be formed above the connecting shaft, thereby increasing the rotating angle of the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate, and improving the pressure borne by the joint to a certain extent.

Preferably, the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate are each provided with anti-skid protrusions in an array mode, and connecting grooves through which the anti-skid protrusions extends are formed between four adjacent anti-skid protrusions.

By adopting the above technical solution, when the second rescue plate is detached from the first rescue plate, the second rescue plate can be connected to the first rescue plate in a limiting manner, which avoids relative sliding of the first rescue plate and the second rescue plate during stacking, and facilitates storage and arrangement.

Preferably, a receiving groove for receiving a bottom portion of a support device is formed on an end surface of the second rescue plate away from the anti-skid protrusions.

By adopting the above technical solution, the receiving groove is arranged such that the bottom portion of the support device can be received on the second rescue plate, the contact area between the support device and the ground is increased, and thereby the pressure intensity exerted by the support device on the ground when in use is reduced, and therefore, the support device is suitable for application occasions with depressions and loose ground surfaces.

In a second aspect, the present application provides a rescue plate, which adopts the following technical solutions.

The rescue plate includes a first rescue plate. At least one end of the first rescue plate is provided with a connecting shaft, and the axis direction of the connecting shaft extends along the width direction of the first rescue plate.

In a third aspect, the present application provides a support plate, which adopts the following technical solutions.

The support plate includes a second rescue plate. At least one end of the second rescue plate is provided with a connecting plate, the connecting plate is formed with a connecting groove through which a connecting shaft of the rescue plate extends, and one side of the connecting plate away from the second rescue plate is provided with an opening communicating with the connecting groove.

To make the aforementioned more comprehensible, several embodiments accompanied with drawings are described in detail as follows.

12032921	"BACKGROUND

The disclosed technology relates generally to controllable natural language generation from an automated computer-based system. Prior systems can generate text, for example, based on words a user has previously typed. These prior systems, however, often rely on probabilities associated with the user's typing habits, or they may rely on statistical models that analyze the probabilities of different words appearing next to or near one another. For example, in some cases, natural language can either be statistically generated to complete users' sentences by predicting highly probable repetitive and mundane short texts. In other cases, prior systems may generate text to resemble human-written texts, but with no effective control over the meaning of the text. That is, the text may appear structurally well-written, but to a reader would be understood as non-sensical, in whole or in part. More importantly, prior systems do not allow a user to control the meaning conveyed by the generated text in such situations and, as a result, while a prior system may generate text that appears structurally well-written, that text is unlikely to convey the meaning intended by the user. This problem is heightened by the fact that a given word form can possess multiple meanings. For example, the word “bass” can refer to a fish, a guitar, a type of singer, etc. Thus, the word itself is merely a surrogate of its actual meaning in a given context, which may be referred to as the word's sense. In many cases, a context of surrounding text may be needed to inform a word's sense. Prior systems tend to generate text based on surface level statistics without accounting for context, such as the context offered by user input or other available text in a document. As a result, while prior systems may generate text, without accounting for context or word sense, such systems may be useful only in generating simple, statistically formed word groups. There is no capability for generating more complex language based on the context dictated by surrounding text (e.g., text appearing before and/or after a text insertion point). And such systems fail to provide the user with control relative to the text generated and, therefore, the user is unable to predictably control the meaning of the generated text or to refine the meaning of generated text with further input to the system.

In still other cases, prior systems may generate language of apparent complexity, but such systems may be specially tailored to generate language that conveys information from predefined datasets, for predefined use cases, and/or in predefined ways. Certain systems may also automatically account for dictionary spellings of words and certain grammar rules, but, in general, these systems are limited to operating relative to short text segments and without the benefit of contextual analysis of surrounding text or of input provided by a user.

There is a significant need for automated natural language generation systems capable of robust generation of text beyond the limitations of prior systems. The disclosed embodiments provide methods and systems for general-purpose controllable natural language generation. The disclosed embodiments allow for the automatic generation of unique natural language that can express specific meaning, determined based on interaction with users, based on analysis of existing text, etc. The disclosed embodiments can generate unique language, such as sentences that may have never been written before, the meaning of which can be effectively controlled by users or by other parameters, for any desired meaning and context of the use of human language, with no need for tailored pre-configuration.

The disclosed embodiments also include semantically infused language models. Such models may include a neural network-based language model explicitly trained to contain contextual relations between abstract semantic features in text, in contrast with prior art, where models can only be trained to learn contextual relations between surface-level words. For example, the disclosed systems may enable a model to learn contextual relations between words and word senses and between words and the properties of the abstract concepts invoked by the text. To achieve this, the disclosed models may be trained to predict the semantic features of masked tokens in text conditioned by their surrounding context.

As described in the sections below, the disclosed language generation systems may provide a user with a significant level of control in generating language of an intended meaning that agrees with the context of user input text and other available text. For example, in some cases, the disclosed systems may generate text output options as semantic paraphrase substitutions for input provided by the user. In other words, the text output options may be generated to convey the meaning, information, concepts, etc. of textual input provided to the system by the user. Further, the disclosed systems, unlike prior systems, may offer a type of closed loop feedback where if text output options generated by the system do not quite match what the user intended, or if the user would like to supplement the generated text output options, the user can modify the input to the system (e.g., adding words, removing certain words, changing the order of words, etc.), and the system will automatically generate one or more refined text output options based on the modified input (and, in some cases, the context of text surrounding a document location where the generated text is to be inserted).

This disclosure generally relates to a structural segment in an engine component.

BACKGROUND

Turbine engines, and particularly gas or combustion turbine engines, are rotary engines that extract energy from a flow of combusted gases passing through the engine onto a multitude of rotating turbine blades, which can be arranged in multiple turbine blade assemblies including disks, blades, and roots.

Turbine speeds are limited by the centrifugal stress that can be applied to the disks, blades, and roots. A high horsepower does not necessary equate to a high output speed. Higher horsepower and speeds can be obtained in special turbines and are frequently specified for large centrifugal compressors. These turbines need very careful checking for lateral critical speeds, torsional critical speeds, radial bearing stabilities, thrust bearings, balance, and permissible flange loadings.

A Campbell diagram is frequently used to determine the effect of multiple excitation frequencies in turbines. Excitation frequencies occur at various speeds which can equate to severe blade vibration.

Embodiments herein relate generally to a charging node, a method performed by the charging node, a User Equipment (UE) and a method performed by the UE. More particularly the embodiments herein relate to handling a subscriber's communication services.

BACKGROUND

Online Charging is a billing methodology in telecommunication networks where charging information for network resource usage is collected in parallel along with the resource usage. 3GPP TS 32.299 V15.4.0 (2018-09) defines online charging as a “charging mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with session/service control is required”. The opposite of online charging is offline charging, and this is defined as a “charging mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered”.

FIG.1afrom section 4.2 of 3GPP TS 32.240 V15.3.0 (2018-09) illustrates an example of a high level common charging architecture applicable to all 3GPP network domains, subsystems and services. Note thatFIG.1aonly provides a common logical view of the charging architecture and information flows for offline and online charging.

Today smart phones or feature phones are capable of running multiple services concurrently. For instance, it is always possible that mobile applications installed on a subscriber phone, i.e. the UE101, is consuming data in the background while the subscriber is making a long distance international call and at the same time some mobile application is sending a status SMS message to a remote server. Thus, these various services are being used by the subscriber in parallel and also charges are being deducted concurrently from subscriber's account. This may lead to reaching the low balance condition of the subscriber's account. The low balance condition may occur when a credit threshold has been reached or fallen below. The term low balance condition and credit threshold may be used interchangeably herein.

Consider the following scenario as an example:

John is an active prepaid subscriber in US having a mobile phone. John is a busy person and likes to multitask to save time. He has a Facebook application on his mobile phone which continuously synchronizes with Facebook servers to get the latest updates about his friends. He is also actively involved in share trading and has an application which continuously gets the latest updates from NASDAQ. These applications continuously consume credit of his prepaid account in real time. John also needs to talk to one of his business associate Mohan which is in India for some important business requirements. On a weekend, John makes a long-distance International call to Mohan and as he is talking, his account balance is getting consumed. Some minutes later, John's account balance reaches the threshold of low balance and he begins getting low balance indicators on his mobile phone. With the current technology, John has two options when the low balance threshold is reached. He is either forced to abort the call early or to do a refill so that he has sufficient balance to continue his communication.

From a 5G network point of view also, if John is using 2 different network slices for 2 different services consuming money from same balance account, he might also face the above described problem if his balance reaches a low balance condition.

Therefore, there is a need to at least mitigate or solve this issue.

SUMMARY

An objective of embodiments herein is therefore to obviate at least one of the above disadvantages and to improve handling of a subscriber's communication services.

According to a first aspect, the object is achieved by a method performed by a charging function for handling a subscriber's communication services. The charging function detects that a subscriber's credit account has reached or fallen below a credit threshold when the subscriber has multiple ongoing communication services consuming credit from the credit account. The charging function sends a threshold notification of the reached or fallen below credit threshold to a UE on which the subscriber has at least one of the multiple ongoing communication services. The charging function determines if a response to the threshold notification has been received from the UE with prioritization of one of the multiple ongoing communication services. If a response with prioritization of one communication service has been received, the charging function initiates termination of all ongoing communication services except the prioritized communication service and provides at least substantially all available credit to be available for the prioritized communication service.

According to a second aspect, the object is achieved by a method performed by a UE for handling a subscriber's communication services. The subscriber has at least one of multiple ongoing communications services ongoing on the UE. The UE receives, from a charging function, a threshold notification of that the subscriber's credit account has reached or fallen below a credit threshold for multiple ongoing communication services consuming credit from the same credit account.

According to a third aspect, the object is achieved by a charging function configured to detect that a subscriber's credit account has reached or fallen below a credit threshold when the subscriber has multiple ongoing communication services consuming credit from the credit account. The charging function is configured to send a threshold notification of the reached or fallen below credit threshold to a UE on which the subscriber has at least one of the multiple ongoing communication services. The charging function is configured to determine if a response to the threshold notification has been received from the UE with prioritization of one of the multiple ongoing communication services. The charging function is configured to, if a response with prioritization of one communication service has been received, initiate termination of all ongoing communication services except the prioritized communication service, and to provide at least substantially all available credit to be available for the prioritized communication service.

According to a fourth aspect, the object is achieved by a UE configured to receive, from a charging function, a threshold notification of that the subscriber's credit account has reached or fallen below a credit threshold for multiple ongoing communication services on the UE consuming credit from the same credit account.

Thanks to the prioritization of one of the multiple ongoing communication services by the UE, the communication service which is considered most important by the subscriber using the UE can continue when a credit threshold of the subscriber's credit account has been reached or fallen below. Consequently, the handling of the subscriber's communication service is improved.

Embodiments herein afford many advantages, of which a non-exhaustive list of examples follows:

One advantage of the embodiments herein is that they enable the system to gracefully handle a low balance condition which increases the user experience.

Another advantage of the embodiments herein is that it increases the user's convenience. The embodiments herein allows the user to focus on current task on his UE, for instance the user can continue talking in a voice call without manually aborting other services, which are consuming his account balance and thus continues his talk without any interruption.

Furthermore, an advantage of the embodiments herein is that they increase the user experience. The user can provide a priority for a prepaid service like voice, data and SMS over others. In case of contention of resource during a low balance condition, the service with highest priority is automatically continued by taking credit units from all other ongoing services. The user will then be able to use the prioritized service for a maximum time depending on the user's account balance.

Another advantage of the embodiments herein is that as a human, the user's attention span is limited to one ongoing activity and the fallback position of the embodiments herein enables prioritization of an ongoing activity without any manual intervention. This allows the user to focus on his current task, for instance the ongoing voice call, and all the remaining credit balance in the user's account is made available to the ongoing prioritized service.

A further advantage of the embodiments herein is that they also help in saving energy and power as any further communication request for credit resources will be blocked in case of the low balance condition, leading to reduced energy consumption.

The embodiments herein are not limited to the features and advantages mentioned above. A person skilled in the art will recognize additional features and advantages upon reading the following detailed description.

11887873	"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to a wafer placement apparatus.

2. Description of the Related Art

A known wafer placement apparatus includes a ceramic plate having an upper surface serving as a wafer placement surface; and a cooling plate provided on a lower surface, opposite the wafer placement surface, of the ceramic plate and in which a refrigerant passage is provided. For example, a cooling plate is disclosed by PTL 1 that has a refrigerant passage running over the entirety thereof. A cooling device is connected to the inlet and the outlet of the refrigerant passage. Refrigerant supplied from the cooling device enters the inlet of the refrigerant passage, flows through the refrigerant passage, exits the outlet of the refrigerant passage, returns into the cooling device, is cooled to a preset temperature in the cooling device, and re-enters the inlet of the refrigerant passage.

PATENT LITERATURE

PTL 1: Japanese Patent No. 6129451

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

While the refrigerant supplied into the refrigerant passage is flowing through the refrigerant passage, the refrigerant continues to be heated by exchanging heat with the ceramic plate. Therefore, the refrigerant in the refrigerant passage exhibits a temperature gradient ascending as the refrigerant flows from the inlet toward the outlet of the refrigerant passage. The greater the length of one refrigerant passage, the greater the distance over which the refrigerant flows while exchanging heat with the ceramic plate. Therefore, if the other conditions are fixed, the greater the length of one refrigerant passage, the higher the temperature of the refrigerant becomes near the outlet of the refrigerant passage. The cooling plate of the wafer placement apparatus according to PTL 1 has one refrigerant passage with one inlet and one outlet. In such a case, the one refrigerant passage is long, and the refrigerant has a high temperature near the outlet. Consequently, there is a great difference in the temperature of the refrigerant between that at the inlet and that at the outlet of the refrigerant passage. Such a situation may reduce the temperature uniformity of the cooling plate in the in-plane direction. Therefore, if such a wafer placement apparatus is employed, the temperature uniformity of each wafer tends to become low.

The present invention is to solve the above problem, and the chief object of the present invention is to increase the temperature uniformity of each wafer.

A wafer placement apparatus according to the present invention includes:

a ceramic plate having an upper surface as a wafer placement surface and in which an electrode is embedded; and

a cooling plate provided on a lower surface, opposite the wafer placement surface, of the ceramic plate and in which a refrigerant passage is provided,

wherein the refrigerant passage includes a first passage forming a single continuous line and extending parallel to the wafer placement surface, and a second passage forming a single continuous line and extending along the first passage, an outlet of the second passage being positioned near an inlet of the first passage, an inlet of the second passage being positioned near an outlet of the first passage.

The above wafer placement apparatus has the refrigerant passage including the first passage and the second passage that are separate from each other. Therefore, the length of one refrigerant passage is short. Accordingly, if refrigerant cooled to a preset temperature by a cooling device or the like is supplied into each of the first and second passages, the refrigerant has a lower temperature around each of the outlets of the passages than in a case of a single refrigerant passage. Thus, the temperature difference in the cooling plate in the in-plane direction can be reduced. Furthermore, in the above wafer placement apparatus, the second passage extends along and paired with the first passage, and the inlet and the outlet of the second passage are positioned inversely with respect to those of the first passage. Therefore, the temperature gradient of the refrigerant in the first passage is offset by the temperature gradient, sloping inversely, of the refrigerant in the second passage. Consequently, the temperature difference in the cooling plate in the in-plane direction can be reduced. With such a wafer placement apparatus, the temperature uniformity of each wafer can be increased.

In this specification, the terms “upper” and “lower” do not define the absolute positional relationship but define the relative positional relationship. Therefore, depending on the orientation of the wafer placement apparatus, the “upper” side and the “lower” side may be expressed in different ways: the “lower” side and the “upper” side, the “left” side and the “right” side, or the “front” side and the “rear” side.

In the wafer placement apparatus according to the present invention, the inlet and the outlet of the first passage may be positioned close to each other, and parts of the passages in a region around the inlet and the outlet of the first passage may be arranged such that an inlet-side part of the first passage, an outlet-side part of the second passage, an inlet-side part of the second passage, and an outlet-side part of the first passage are adjacent to one another in that order. To gather tubes for supplying and discharging the refrigerant close to one another, the inlets and the outlets of the refrigerant passages are often positioned close to one another. However, if the inlet for the low-temperature refrigerant and the outlet for the high-temperature refrigerant are positioned close to each other, the temperature gradient of the cooling plate may locally become steep in a region between the inlet and the outlet that are adjacent to each other. Therefore, in the region around the inlet and the outlet of the first passage that are close to each other, parts of the passages are arranged such that the inlet-side part of the first passage, the outlet-side part of the second passage, the inlet-side part of the second passage, and the outlet-side part of the first passage are adjacent to one another in that order. In such a case, if the inlet and the outlet of the first passage are adjacent to each other, the temperature gradient of the cooling plate that may locally become steep in the region between the inlet and the outlet that are adjacent to each other is offset by the temperature gradient, sloping inversely, of the cooling plate in a region between the outlet-side part and the inlet-side part of the second passage. Consequently, the temperature difference in the cooling plate in the in-plane direction can be reduced further.

In the wafer placement apparatus according to the present invention, the first passage and the second passage may each have a swirling shape. If the passages each have a swirling shape, the outlet-side part of the passages and the inlet-side part of the passages are alternately positioned, and there is no chance that the outlet-side part of the passages is positioned adjacent to the outlet-side part of the passages, or the inlet-side part of the passages is positioned adjacent to the inlet-side part of the passages.

In the wafer placement apparatus according to the present invention, the first passage and the second passage may each swirl from the inlet in an outer peripheral part of the cooling plate to a central part of the cooling plate, make a turn in the central part, and swirl back from the turn to the outlet in the outer peripheral part; or the first passage and the second passage may each swirl from the inlet in the central part to the outer peripheral part, make a turn in the outer peripheral part, and swirl back from the turn to the outlet in the central part. In such a case, the first passage and the second passage can be formed into the respective swirling shapes such that the inlets and the outlets of the first and second passages are positioned close to one another. Furthermore, in the region around the inlet and the outlet of the first passage, parts of the passages can be arranged such that the inlet-side part of the first passage, the outlet-side part of the second passage, the inlet-side part of the second passage, and the outlet-side part of the first passage are adjacent to one another in that order. Consequently, the temperature difference in the cooling plate in the in-plane direction can be reduced further.

The present disclosure generally relates to the field of computer peripheral devices. In particular, the present disclosure is directed to computer peripheral devices designed to be selectively configured into one of a plurality of configurations for selectively generating peripheral device command signals.

BACKGROUND

Modern video conferencing software typically has a set of two commonly used controls, the video on/off control and the microphone on/off control, the latter also referred to as the mute control. Users often need to use the mute control during a call, especially during calls with more than two people. The user can either select a control button of a graphical user interface (GUI) or use a keyboard shortcut. The keyboard shortcut is typically a combination of two or more keyboard keys that must be quickly located and then depressed at the same time. Utilizing either the GUI or keyboard shortcut in the moment can be challenging even for experienced users. A related issue is an uncertainty of mute status. The software's onscreen status indicator is often difficult to locate, resulting in users being muted when they want to talk and inadvertently talking on the call when they thought they were on mute.

12038077	"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a strain wave gearing provided with a mechanism for regulating axial-direction movement of an externally toothed gear.

BACKGROUND ART

Known examples of strain wave gearings include flat strain wave gearings. Flat strain wave gearings are susceptible to “walking,” in which an externally toothed gear moves in the axial direction (thrust direction). Normally, a regulating member (F/S deviation-preventing part: plate, retaining ring, or the like) for regulating movement of the externally toothed gear is arranged in order to regulate axial-direction movement of the externally toothed gear to within a permissible variable range (Patent Literature 1 and 2). It has also been proposed that, inter alia, an endless spring or the like be arranged at a site on the externally toothed gear (Patent Literature 3), or the externally toothed gear be configured as a double helical gear.

PRIOR-ART LITERATURE

Patent Literature 1: JP 2014-199130 APatent Literature 2: JPU H03-119643 APatent Literature 3: WO2016/194066

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION

Problems to be Solved by the Invention

However, in prior-art mechanisms for regulating axial-direction movement of an externally toothed gear in a strain wave gearing, problems are presented in that axial-direction displacement, even if very small, does occur in the externally toothed gear, and friction loss caused by sliding of portions in contact with a regulating member is high.

It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a strain wave gearing in which axial-direction displacement of an externally toothed gear can be suppressed and in which friction loss caused by sliding of a portion in contact with a member for regulating axial-direction movement of the externally toothed gear can be greatly reduced.

Means of Solving the Problems

In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, a strain wave gearing according to the present invention hasa fixed-side first internally toothed gear and a rotating-side second internally toothed gear arranged so as to be lined up coaxially in an axial direction,a radially flexible cylindrical externally toothed gear arranged coaxially inside the first and second internally toothed gears,a wave generator that causes the externally toothed gear to flex in a radial direction and partially mesh with each of the first and second internally toothed gears, and that causes meshing positions of the gears to move in a circumferential direction, anda first regulating part arranged on a side of the first internally toothed gear in the axial direction and a second regulating part arranged on a side of the second internally toothed gear in the axial direction, the first and second regulating parts sandwiching the externally toothed gear, in order to regulate axial-direction movement of the externally toothed gear,the strain wave gearing being characterized in that:the first regulating part is provided with a first raceway groove formed in a first annular end surface of the externally toothed gear, the first annular end being on the side of the first internally toothed gear in the axial direction, a fixed-side raceway groove formed in a fixed-side member that faces the first raceway groove in the axial direction, and a plurality of first rolling elements sandwiched between the first raceway groove and the fixed-side raceway groove in a state that allows rolling; andthe second regulating part is provided with a second raceway groove formed in a second annular end surface of the externally toothed gear, the second annular end being on the side of the second internally toothed gear in the axial direction, a rotating-side raceway groove formed in a rotating-side member that faces the second raceway groove in the axial direction and that rotates integrally with the second internally toothed gear, and a plurality of second rolling elements sandwiched between the second raceway groove and the rotating-side raceway groove in a state that allows rolling.

The first rolling elements are preferably held between the first raceway groove and the fixed-side raceway groove in the first regulating part in a state of prescribed pressurization in the axial direction. Additionally, the second rolling elements are preferably held between the second raceway groove and the rolling-side raceway groove in the second regulating part in a state of prescribed pressurization in the axial direction.

The rim thickness of the externally toothed gear is increased, whereby the first and second annular end surfaces of the externally toothed gear on both sides thereof in the axial direction are provided with widths that allow formation of the first and second raceway grooves in which the rolling elements roll, and the first and second regulating parts can be provided.

Effects of the Invention

In the strain wave gearing according to the present invention, the rolling elements are directly interposed between the externally toothed gear and the fixed-side member and between the externally toothed gear and the rotating-side member on the two sides, the two members regulating axial-direction movement of the externally toothed gear, whereby the externally toothed gear is rolling contact with the fixed-side member and with the rotating-side member. No contact occurs other than rolling contact of contact portions, and therefore it is possible to greatly reduce friction loss caused by sliding of the contact portions. Additionally, pressure is applied along the axial direction to the portions that make rolling contact, and axial-direction rattling is eliminated, whereby axial-direction movement of the externally toothed gear is reliably suppressed, and generation of high thrust force is prevented. As a result, the efficiency of the strain wave gearing can be improved.

12067089	"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The subject disclosure relates to a split ledger software licensing platform.

BACKGROUND

Software can be distributed under many kinds of licenses, ranging from open-source freeware to pay per use, and everything in between. In large companies and business to business sales, customers often report usage without providing a software vendor with a way to verify how many copies of the software were in use over a given time period. For example, a large company might have an open-ended contract with a software vendor for a ubiquitous product. The license requires the large company to specify a quantity of licenses that were used over a given month or quarter. The quantity of licenses changes for a variety of reasons, including staffing considerations.

One of the more difficult issues is how software handles offline work, as many users are not able to connect to the network every time that they use software. This problem becomes an issue since the software continues to function even if the device gets disconnected from the network. Further, large organizations often prefer bulk contracts that allow multiple users to have access to the software. These bulk contracts should be updated as the conditions of the organization change.

11897369	"BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a system and method for reducing motion sickness symptoms.

Methods that are applied in order to avoid motion sickness during a drive are already known from the prior art.

DE 10 2015 011 708 A1 discloses a method in which manual inputs by an occupant (health parameters) are correlated with vehicle parameters and route parameters in order to determine a discomfort threshold in terms of motion sickness-induced illness. In order to counteract the occurrence of motion sickness-induced illness, the vehicle is then air-conditioned, fragranced and/or a seat massage function is activated.

The methods known from the prior art record the risk of motion sickness-induced illness in a passenger and recommend countermeasures in order to avoid the occurrence of motion sickness in the passenger, for example based on the parameters input by the passenger.

As a result of concentrated activities, for example on a monitor, that are additionally possible as a result of autonomous vehicle guidance, the occupant easily loses the spatial reference with respect to the vehicle surroundings. The accelerations, rotations and changes in incline nevertheless acting dynamically on said occupant and perceived physiologically thereby are therefore no longer congruent and in accordance with his actual optical perception. The occupant may therefore become unwell and nauseous, and if this continues the occupant may become dizzy and/or be sick (motion sickness).

Although countermeasures (ventilation, massage, etc.) are initiated in the methods known from the prior art, it is not clear in this case whether these also help each occupant with regard to motion sickness symptoms that suddenly occur.

One object of the invention is therefore to provide a system and a method for reducing motion sickness symptoms that at least partly overcomes the disadvantages of the methods known from the prior art.

The object is achieved by the features of the independent patent claims. Advantageous embodiments are described in the dependent claims. It is pointed out that additional features of a patent claim dependent on an independent patent claim, without the features of the independent patent claim or in combination only with a subset of the features of the independent patent claim, may form a separate invention independent of the combination of all of the features of the independent patent claim that may be made into the subject matter of an independent claim, of a divisional application or of a subsequent application. This applies analogously to the technical teaching described in the description, which teaching may form an invention independent of the features of the independent patent claims.

A first aspect of the invention relates to a system for reducing motion sickness symptoms for a vehicle, wherein the system has a control unit that is coupled to a sensor system and/or to a navigation system, to a vehicle seat system and/or to a display unit in order to receive and/or emit signals.

The control unit is preferably coupled to a sensor system and/or to a navigation system, to a vehicle seat system and to a display unit in order to receive and/or emit signals. If the display and the vehicle seat are controlled accordingly, the risk of motion sickness symptoms arising for the vehicle occupants is able to be reduced considerably.

The term “motion sickness” is understood to mean an illness caused by the influence of movements on the human body. Motion sickness is usually also referred to as travel sickness and usually called seasickness, airsickness or space sickness depending on where the movement takes place. Motion sickness is caused by movement and in particular by repeated acceleration procedures with changing acceleration values and acceleration directions. Motion sickness symptoms comprise nausea, vomiting, dizziness, paleness, a drop in blood pressure, palpitations, outbreaks of sweating and hyperventilation.

A vehicle within the meaning of the present document should be understood to mean any vehicle by way of which people and/or goods are able to be moved. Possible examples of a vehicle are: motor vehicle, truck, land vehicles, buses, driver's cabins, cable cars, elevator cars, rail vehicles, watercraft (for example ships, boats, submarines, diving bells, hovercraft, hydrofoils), aircraft (aeroplanes, helicopters, ground effect vehicles, airships, balloons). The vehicle is preferably a motor vehicle. A motor vehicle in this sense is a land vehicle that is moved by mechanical force without being linked to rails. A motor vehicle in this sense comprises a motor car, a motorcycle and a traction unit.

The control unit is a unit that receives information, for example in the form of signals and/or data, from a device, processes it and provides it to a further device or prompts the further device to perform a certain action. For this purpose, the control unit is coupled in terms of communication to one or more devices, such as for example to the sensor system, the navigation system, the vehicle seat system and/or the display unit, that is to say so as to receive and/or emit signals. The coupling (in terms of communication) may be wireless (for example Bluetooth, WLAN, mobile radio) or wired (for example by way of a USB interface, data cable, etc.). Even if the control unit is described as a unit, then this should also be understood to mean a control unit that has a plurality of parts. For example, the term “control unit” also includes the situation in which individual control functions are distributed to other devices mentioned in this document. This could be the case for example when the function of generating the seat adjustment signals is performed in the vehicle seat system itself. In other words, parts of the control unit may be distributed to devices, such as for example the sensor system, the navigation system, the vehicle seat system and/or the display unit.

The control unit and/or the sensor system and/or the navigation system or one or more components thereof may be a device in the vehicle. In addition or as an alternative thereto, it may be an external device, for example a stationary device and/or a mobile terminal.

The sensor system and the navigation system are configured so as to receive surroundings data of the vehicle and transmit them to the control unit. Surroundings data of the vehicle mean data that relate to the surroundings of the vehicle. Such surroundings data comprise weather data, topology data (in particular topology data about the route to be traveled, such as for example the occurrence of curves, hills and/or traffic lights, the flatness of the roadway or lack of flatness of the roadway), route data, surroundings data (in particular surroundings data determined by the sensor system with the additional assistance of a surroundings model), data about the start and/or destination of a selected route, etc. Surroundings data in particular mean data that have an effect on the vehicle from outside the vehicle. The surroundings data are preferably obtained using highly accurate maps.

The sensor system and the navigation system are furthermore configured so as to receive vehicle component data of the vehicle, from which movements of the vehicle result, and to transmit them to the control unit. Such vehicle component data comprise data about engine components, chassis components (brake system, suspension, damping system, steering system, wheel suspension, wheels, tires, etc.), bodywork components, force transmission components (for example transmission, shaft, clutch, etc.). The movements of the vehicle, which result from the movement of the vehicle components, comprise translational and rotational movements in the direction of the vehicle longitudinal axis, vehicle transverse axis and vehicle height axis.

The sensor system comprises at least one of the following apparatuses: ultrasound sensor, radar sensor (for example short-range radar sensor, long-range radar sensor), lidar sensor, position inertial system (for example piezo system, longitudinal and rotational acceleration system), video system and/or image sensor (for example camera). The data of the sensor system may stem from one of the abovementioned apparatuses or from a combination of a plurality of the abovementioned apparatuses (sensor data fusion).

A navigation system within the meaning of the present document should be understood to mean a system that makes it possible to create a route and enables guidance to a selected destination through position determination (for example GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou, etc.) and/or geographical information (topology maps, road maps, air maps or sea maps).

The surroundings data may be received by the sensor system and/or the navigation system and transmitted to the control unit. The vehicle component data may likewise be received by the sensor system and/or the navigation system and transmitted to the control unit.

The vehicle seat system is configured so as to receive seat adjustment signals from the control unit and to adjust at least one vehicle seat of the vehicle in accordance with the received seat adjustment signals.

A vehicle seat system within the meaning of the present document comprises at least one vehicle seat that is suitable for accommodating a seated vehicle occupant.

The term vehicle occupant in the present document should be understood to mean any person in the vehicle. The term vehicle occupant should be understood to mean both the driver and a driver who is not driving himself, as well as any passenger.

The vehicle seat system furthermore comprises an adjustment apparatus by way of which the at least one vehicle seat is able to be adjusted. In order to adjust the at least one vehicle seat, the vehicle seat system, in particular the adjustment apparatus of the vehicle seat system, receives seat adjustment signals from the control unit. The at least one vehicle seat is able to be rotated about its transverse, height and longitudinal axis and/or moved along its transverse, height and longitudinal axis by way of the adjustment apparatus of the vehicle seat system. The vehicle seat system may comprise seat rails for moving a vehicle seat, an adjustment device for adjusting the seat incline and/or seat height and/or a lordosis support.

The display unit is configured so as to receive display signals from the control unit and to display them. The display unit may have one or more display devices. The display signals are displayed acoustically, optically or haptically.

According to a further embodiment, the display signals comprise perception elements that are obtained at least in part from the surroundings data, wherein the perception elements reflect the surroundings, external to the vehicle, around the vehicle from the view of a vehicle occupant. The perception elements may be recordings, in particular real-time recordings, of a camera or a plurality of cameras and/or be artificially generated images. The camera recordings, in particular real-time camera recordings, may be generated for example by a camera fastened in the interior of the vehicle and that looks out of the vehicle in the direction of travel. As an alternative or in addition thereto, surroundings data that are generated for example by a surroundings sensor system may be processed into image data (artificially generated images) that are able to be displayed on the display unit.

The display signals preferably comprise image and/or video recordings of the surrounding traffic. In other words, the surroundings around the vehicle are displayed. That is to say for example the profile of the road, the topology (town, countryside, mountains), the vegetation (desert, forest, beach), the weather (sun, rain, snow), the time of day (daytime, nighttime), etc.

The display unit may have one or more existing display devices and/or one or more separate display devices. Exemplary implementations of such display devices may be a display means of the dashboard, a display (for example in the cockpit area and/or on the rear part of a vehicle seat and/or on the interior lining of the vehicle), a head-up display (for example in one or more of the windows of the vehicle), an infotainment system, an on-board computer, a communication unit, a combined instrument, a mobile terminal, etc.

The term “combined instrument” in the present document is understood to mean an operating unit that comprises displays and/or functions that relate inter alia to the following: tachometer, mileage counter, revolution counter, fuel level display, coolant temperature display, monitoring lights and direction indicators.

The term “infotainment system” in the present document is understood to mean an operating unit that comprises a plurality of functions that relate to information and/or entertainment. Such functions relate to the following devices: car radio, navigation system, hands-free talking apparatus, on-board computer, driving data display, air-conditioning system, driver assistance systems.

The infotainment system and the combined instrument have various interfaces to one or more of the following: one or more controllers, external devices, preferably electronic terminals, storage media, data sources, computer unit.

One or more display devices may be arranged on interior fitting elements of the vehicle. Interior fitting elements should be understood to mean all of the components within a vehicle that are visible to vehicle occupants. Examples of interior fitting elements are: front seat or back of the front seat, rear seat or back of the rear seat, door lining, side lining, instrument panel, vehicle roof, sun visor, carpet, central console, parcel shelf, sun blind, steering wheel, interior mirror, etc.

A mobile terminal is a device that is able to communicate wirelessly in a mobile network via local area networks (LANs), such as for example Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), or via wide area networks (WANs), such as for example Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), General Package Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), High Speed Downlink/Uplink Packet Access (HSDPA, HSUPA), Long-Term Evolution (LTE), or World Wide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WIMAX). Communication using other current or future communication technologies is possible. The term mobile terminal in particular includes smartphones, but also other mobile telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs and all current and future electronic devices that are equipped with technology for loading and executing apps. The mobile terminal may be coupled to the vehicle via an appropriate communication interface, for example a Bluetooth interface. As an alternative thereto, an app on the mobile terminal may be linked to the vehicle by way of a suitable authentication method via a server. All current and future authentication methods such as knowledge (for example username and password, PIN, security question, etc.), possession (for example SIM card, certificate, smartcard), biometrics (for example fingerprint, facial recognition) and any combination of the individual authentication methods come into consideration as authentication.

The control unit is configured so as to generate seat adjustment signals and/or display signals depending on the received surroundings data and/or vehicle component data.

The control unit is preferably configured so as to generate seat adjustment signals and display signals depending on the received surroundings data and/or vehicle component data. By generating and applying the seat adjustment signals and the display signals, the vehicle occupants are able to regain the spatial reference with respect to the vehicle surroundings, while at the same time the acceleration forces acting thereon are as far as possible minimized. The occurrence of motion sickness symptoms is thereby able to be reduced significantly or even avoided.

Generating the seat adjustment signals comprises the following actions: determining first acceleration forces acting on a vehicle occupant sitting on a vehicle seat due to the movements of the vehicle using the surroundings data and/or vehicle component data; and determining seat adjustment signals that are designed such that they bring about second acceleration forces that counteract the first acceleration forces for the vehicle occupant after adjusting the vehicle seat in accordance with these seat adjustment signals.

The seat adjustment signals are preferably determined automatically and dynamically. The at least one vehicle seat is likewise preferably adjusted automatically and dynamically in accordance with the seat adjustment signals. This means that, as soon as the first acceleration forces are determined, the seat adjustment signals are generated continuously and/or the vehicle seat or vehicle seats are adjusted continuously substantially without a time delay (phase shift) and/or scaling taking place. That is to say, the seat adjustment signals are generated in real time and/or the vehicle seat or vehicle seats are adjusted in real time. In other words, the seat adjustment signals are generated and/or the vehicle seat or vehicle seats are adjusted even before the vehicle occupant or the vehicle occupants each perceive the first acceleration forces. By virtue of adjusting the vehicle seat or vehicle seats in accordance with the seat adjustment signals, the vehicle occupant or vehicle occupants do not perceive the first acceleration forces, but rather the actually acting acceleration forces. The actually acting acceleration forces are the acceleration forces that remain when the second acceleration forces counteract the first acceleration forces. In the best case scenario, the first acceleration forces cancel out the second acceleration forces and the actually acting acceleration forces are zero.

In order to generate the respective seat adjustment signals (that is to say seat adjustment signals for just one vehicle seat or a plurality of vehicle seats), the movements of the vehicle, caused by the surroundings of the vehicle (for example bumpy ground) and/or by the movement of vehicle components (for example shaking of the passenger compartment), are thus first of all determined. The acceleration forces (first acceleration forces) acting on the vehicle occupant sitting on the respective vehicle seat are then determined through the determined movements of the vehicle. Second acceleration forces that counteract the first acceleration forces are then determined. Seat adjustment signals by way of which the second acceleration forces act on a vehicle occupant sitting on the respective vehicle seat are determined accordingly.

By way of example, during positive longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle and in the case of a vehicle occupant sitting in the direction of travel, a vehicle seat may be inclined forward to the extent that said vehicle occupant no longer perceives any (unpleasant) longitudinal acceleration. According to a further example, when entering a constant right-hand curve, the vehicle seat may be rotated to the left about the height axis such that the vehicle occupant is taken into the current turn rate only very slowly and subliminally. When traveling through the right-hand curve, the vehicle seat may be tilted to the right (in the direction of travel) to the extent that the vehicle occupant no longer perceives any (unpleasant) transverse acceleration. In a further example, in the case of a vertically oriented vertical impact caused by driving over a speed bump, the vehicle seat may be congruently moved downward such that the exposure to the impact is negligible to the vehicle occupant.

Generating the display signals comprises the following actions: determining the acceleration forces actually acting on the vehicle occupant on the vehicle seat adjusted in accordance with the seat adjustment signals; and determining display signals that are designed such that they bring about a sensory perception, congruent with the actually acting acceleration forces, for the vehicle occupant on the vehicle seat adjusted in accordance with the seat adjustment signals.

A sensory perception within the meaning of the present document comprises at least one of the following: visual perception, auditive perception, sensitivity (in particular tactile perception), olfactory perception and gustatory perception.

If the vehicle occupant were thus for example to experience actually acting acceleration forces that correspond to the acceleration of the vehicle, then the display signals are designed such that the vehicle occupant sensually perceives an acceleration of the vehicle. If the vehicle occupant were for example to experience actually acting acceleration forces that are equal to zero, then the display signals are designed such that the vehicle occupant does not sensually perceive any change in the driving of the vehicle.

Using the system or method described in the present document for reducing motion sickness symptoms, congruence between sensory stimulus and positional sensation is able to be created for each vehicle occupant. The dynamic positional sensation is alleviated or compensated by dynamically adjusting the vehicle seat or the vehicle seats. As a result, contradictory signals from the eyes, balance organs and articular receptors are avoided, and typical symptoms of travel sickness (motion sickness) are able to be reduced or even eliminated.

The display signals are advantageously displayed only for a certain duration if the seat adjustment signals change significantly in comparison with the currently adjusted vehicle seat or the currently adjusted vehicle seats. This is the case for example when the vehicle drives through a curve or over bumpy ground. If the vehicle however travels straight ahead over a substantially flat route, the generated seat adjustment signals would not be significantly different from the seat adjustment signals that led to the currently adjusted vehicle seat or the currently adjusted vehicle seats. In other words, the display signals are not displayed in quiet driving situations in which few or even no acceleration forces occur for the vehicle occupants.

The vehicle occupants are therefore not disrupted due to display signals that are displayed unnecessarily, and are able to concentrate on the tasks that they are performing, such as for example working on a computer.

The sensor system and the navigation system are advantageously furthermore configured so as to receive surroundings data and/or vehicle component data of the vehicle, from which movements of the vehicle result, and/or to transmit them to the control unit, only when the vehicle is at least in a partly automated driving mode, preferably at least in a highly automated driving mode and even more preferably in a fully automated driving mode.

As an alternative or in addition thereto, the control unit is advantageously furthermore configured so as to generate seat adjustment signals and/or display signals only when the vehicle is at least in a partly automated driving mode, preferably at least in a highly automated driving mode and even more preferably in a fully automated driving mode.

The automated driving modes mentioned in this document (partly automated driving mode, highly automated driving mode and fully automated or autonomous driving mode) correspond to the degrees of automation defined by the German Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) (see BASt publication “Forschung kompakt” [Compact research], issued November 2012). In the case of partly automated driving (TAF), the system takes over the longitudinal and transverse guidance for a certain duration and/or in specific situations, wherein the driver has to continuously monitor the system. In the case of highly automated driving (HAF), the system takes over the longitudinal and transverse guidance for a certain duration without the driver having to continuously monitor the system; the driver must however be capable within a certain time of taking over vehicle guidance. In the case of fully automated (autonomous) driving (VAF), the system is able to automatically manage driving in all situations for a specific application case; a driver is then no longer required for this application case. The degrees of automation mentioned above in accordance with the definition of the BASt correspond to SAE Levels 2 to 4 of the SAE J3016 standard (SAE—Society of Automotive Engineering). By way of example, highly automated driving (HAF) according to the BASt corresponds to Level 3 of the SAE J3016 standard. SAE J3016 furthermore also provides SAE Level 5 as the highest degree of automation, this not being contained in the definition of the BASt. SAE Level 5 corresponds to driverless driving, in which the system is able to automatically manage all situations in the same way as a human driver throughout the entire journey; a driver is generally no longer required. The “fully automated” degree of automation is intended to jointly incorporate the case of driverless driving in the present document.

According to one embodiment, the control unit is furthermore configured so as to generate the seat adjustment signals only for a vehicle seat whose orientation deviates from the direction of travel of the vehicle; in addition or as an alternative thereto, the vehicle seat system is furthermore configured so as to receive seat adjustment signals from the control unit only for a vehicle seat whose orientation deviates from the direction of travel of the vehicle; in addition or as an alternative thereto, the vehicle seat system is furthermore configured so as to adjust only a vehicle seat whose orientation deviates from the direction of travel of the vehicle in accordance with the received seat adjustment signals.

As a result, only vehicle seats that are not oriented in the direction of travel are adjusted. The vehicle seat of a vehicle occupant sitting on the vehicle seat that is in the direction of travel in any case is accordingly not adjusted.

According to one embodiment, the display signals comprise at least one of the following: artificial optical surroundings, wherein the artificial optical surroundings are preferably displayed in an edge region of a display device; artificial optical surroundings, wherein the artificial optical surroundings are displayed outside the central sharply focused viewing axis of the respective vehicle occupant and within the individual field of view of the respective vehicle occupant; artificial acoustic surroundings; holographic image elements; air flows; and haptic effects on a vehicle occupant, in particular massage effects and/or vibration effects.

Holographic image elements are visual image elements that are created by way of holographic methods. By virtue of using holographic image elements, the display of the display signals may be designed to be variable in the interior of the vehicle and is not restricted to existing display devices such as displays, interior lining, windows, etc.

The term “artificial optical surroundings” means surroundings that are not real, that is to say artificially created visually perceptible surroundings.

As an alternative or in addition, the artificial optical surroundings may be displayed as an additive depiction in a display of an existing display device, for example as being blended into a navigation display.

The artificial optical surroundings are advantageously controlled depending on the current viewing direction of a vehicle occupant. This means that the artificial optical surroundings are displayed depending on the current viewing direction of a vehicle occupant outside the central sharply focused viewing axis of the vehicle occupant and within the individual field of view of the vehicle occupant. In other words, the artificial optical surroundings are displayed at the “eye angle” of the respective vehicle occupant.

The viewing direction of a vehicle occupant may be recorded using a viewing direction recording unit, such as for example a vehicle interior camera.

By recording the viewing direction of the respective vehicle occupant, the optical perception of the respective vehicle occupant is able to be congruently adapted in a particularly ergonomic manner to the positional and acceleration sensation of the respective vehicle occupant, without the vehicle occupant being distracted from his actual main task.

The artificial optical surroundings may be generated by a lighting system that comprises at least one lighting element. Exemplary lighting elements are: an LED light system, a laser light system, a vehicle interior light system (for example ambient lighting), etc. The lighting system preferably comprises at least one lighting element and a projection surface onto which the artificial optical surroundings are projected. The artificial optical surroundings may be depicted specifically in image form or in abstract form.

The artificial acoustic surroundings may be generated by a sonication system that comprises at least one sonication element. Exemplary sonication elements are: an entertainment system, a communication system, an infotainment system, speaker, etc.

By generating and applying the seat adjustment signals and display signals, the loading in terms of driving dynamics acting on the vehicle occupant is reduced and the discrepancy in the correlation between positional sensation and optical position perception is reduced or even compensated.

By way of example, during longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle and in the case of a vehicle occupant sitting in the direction of travel, the vehicle seat may be inclined forward to the extent that said vehicle occupant perceives a reduced or no longitudinal acceleration, and at the same time the artificial optical surroundings are moved to the extent that they correspond precisely to the change in the viewing direction caused by the change in the vehicle seat incline or that they at least partly optically compensate the acceleration component not completely compensated by the change in the seat incline. In a further example, the vehicle seat may be rotated to the left about the height axis upon entering a constant right-hand curve such that the vehicle occupant is taken into the current rotation rate only very slowly and subliminally, and at the same time the artificial optical surroundings are moved to the extent that they correspond precisely to the change in the viewing direction caused by the change in the vehicle seat orientation or that they at least partly optically compensate the acceleration component not completely compensated by the change in the vehicle seat orientation. When traveling through the right-hand curve, the vehicle seat may be tilted to the right (in the direction of travel) to the extent that the vehicle occupant no longer perceives any (unpleasant) transverse acceleration. In a further example, in the case of a vertically oriented vertical impact caused by driving over a speed bump, the vehicle seat may be congruently moved downward such that the exposure to the impact is negligible for the vehicle occupant, and at the same time the artificial optical surroundings are moved to the extent that they correspond precisely to the change in the viewing height caused by the dynamic change in the vertical seat position or that they at least partly optically compensate the acceleration component not completely compensated by the change in the seat position.

According to a further embodiment, the second acceleration forces are large enough that the first acceleration forces and the second acceleration forces cancel one another out. In other words, a vehicle occupant sitting on the respective vehicle seat does not perceive any acceleration.

According to a further embodiment, the display signals are varied depending on the surroundings of the vehicle and/or the time of day and/or the weather. Examples of the respective surroundings are: city, countryside, forest, desert, body of water, mountains, tunnel, etc. The brightness of optical display signals is for example reduced when driving through a tunnel and increased again when leaving the tunnel. Examples of the respective time of day are: daytime, twilight, nighttime. Examples of the respective weather are: sun, snow, rain, mist.

According to one embodiment, the display unit is designed such that the displayed display signals are not visible at the same time to all vehicle occupants.

The display unit may have a plurality of display devices, wherein each vehicle occupant is assigned a display device for displaying the display signals. By way of example, each vehicle occupant is assigned a display.

According to one embodiment, the display unit is designed such that the displayed display signals are visible only to one vehicle occupant or a particular subset of the vehicle occupants.

The display signals are preferably displayed so as to be visible only to the vehicle occupant or vehicle occupants who are on vehicle seats not oriented in the direction of travel.

The display signals are then displayed only on the display devices assigned to those vehicle occupants who are on their respective vehicle seat not oriented in the direction of travel.

As an alternative or in addition, one or more display devices may be equipped with view protection apparatuses (for example view protection films, view protection filters, particular display methods, etc.) in order to make the displayed display signals visible only to one vehicle occupant or a particular subset of the vehicle occupants, and not at the same time to all vehicle occupants.

By way of example, displays are arranged in each case in the backs of the front vehicle seats and/or side linings for the vehicle occupants in the back seat.

According to one embodiment, the system for reducing motion sickness symptoms furthermore has a warning unit that is coupled to the control unit in order to receive and/or emit signals. The control unit is furthermore configured so as to use the received surroundings data and/or vehicle component data to determine whether the vehicle will have an unavoidable crash within a predefined duration and, in the event that the vehicle will have an unavoidable crash within the predefined duration, to generate warning signals that are designed such that they bring about reflex protective reactions in vehicle occupants.

The predefined duration is 0-30 seconds, preferably 1-20 seconds, particularly preferably 2-10 seconds.

The term crash means an event in which the vehicle is put in a situation that deviates greatly from the previous situation and is thus not expected by the vehicle occupant or the vehicle occupants. This may be the case for example when the vehicle suddenly brakes abruptly, whether this be through a braking maneuver or a collision with an object. The term crash preferably comprises a collision of the vehicle with an object.

Due to the fact that the vehicle occupants do not experience any acceleration forces or experience only reduced acceleration forces or are concentrating on a perceived task, the in particular reflex protective measures normally brought about by a crash are not automatically triggered in the vehicle occupants. In order nevertheless to optimally prepare the vehicle occupants for the consequences of a crash, the warning unit therefore emits warning signals.

The warning unit may comprise devices internal to the vehicle that are suitable for warning vehicle occupants. Such devices internal to the vehicle are for example: speaker, seat massage unit, ventilation system, infotainment system, steering wheel, etc.

The warning signals comprise visual signals and/or acoustic signals and/or haptic signals and/or olfactory signals. In other words, the warning signals are designed such that they address the visual perception and/or auditive perception and/or haptic perception and/or olfactory perception of the vehicle occupant or vehicle occupants. The warning signals are designed such that they incite the vehicle occupant or vehicle occupants in a reflex manner to perform physical protective reactions, for example adopting a physical protective position.

The warning unit preferably comprises speakers internal to the vehicle that emit acoustic warning signals. In addition or as an alternative, the warning unit preferably comprises a steering wheel with a vibration function that emits warning signals through vibrations.

The warning unit outputs warning signals only when a crash is unavoidable within a predefined duration. This means that the calculation works out that there is no possible action (for example avoidance maneuver) that could avoid a crash. The warning signals from the warning unit therefore do not correspond to the signals that a pedestrian protection or collision protection system outputs for example in order to incite the driver of a vehicle to perform a particular action (for example braking). The warning signals within the meaning of the present document should be understood to mean the possibility of preparing a vehicle occupant for the crash that will take place in order to minimize the physical consequences of the crash (injuries).

According to one embodiment, the system for reducing motion sickness symptoms furthermore comprises a monitoring unit that is coupled to the control unit in order to receive and/or emit signals. The monitoring unit is configured so as to monitor whether a vehicle occupant is capable of perceiving a situation external to the vehicle, and to emit a positive monitoring signal to the control unit if the respective vehicle occupant is capable, and to emit a negative monitoring signal to the control unit if the respective vehicle occupant is incapable. The control unit is furthermore configured so as to generate seat adjustment signals for the vehicle seat on which the respective vehicle occupant is sitting and/or to generate display signals for the respective vehicle occupant only if a negative monitoring signal is present. The display unit is furthermore configured such that the displayed display signals are visible in each case just to one vehicle occupant.

According to a further embodiment, the system for reducing motion sickness symptoms furthermore has a monitoring unit that is coupled to the control unit in order to receive and/or emit signals and is configured so as to monitor whether a vehicle occupant is capable of perceiving a situation external to the vehicle, and to emit a positive monitoring signal to the control unit if the respective vehicle occupant is capable, and to emit a negative monitoring signal to the control unit if the respective vehicle occupant is incapable. The vehicle seat system is furthermore configured so as to receive seat adjustment signals for the vehicle seat on which the respective vehicle occupant is sitting and/or to adjust the vehicle seat on which the respective vehicle occupant is sitting only if a negative monitoring signal is present. The display unit is furthermore configured so as to receive and/or to display display signals for the respective vehicle occupant only if a negative monitoring signal is present.

In order to monitor whether a vehicle occupant is capable of perceiving a situation external to the vehicle, the monitoring unit may comprise one or more sensors, in particular a camera (for example interior camera), that evaluates biometric features of the vehicle occupant. Biometric features comprise in particular: facial geometry, iris recognition, lip movement, voice recognition, keystroke behavior (for example on a smartphone, keyboard, etc.), fingerprint. Situation external to the vehicle means situations that take place outside the vehicle. A situation may mean an event, but also the surroundings (for example row of trees) outside a vehicle.

If the monitoring unit for example records that a vehicle occupant has lowered his head and directed his eyes toward a smartphone display, then it is assumed that the respective vehicle occupant is not capable of perceiving a situation external to the vehicle. A negative monitoring signal is therefore then emitted to the control unit.

According to a further embodiment, the surroundings data and vehicle component data comprise only data from which movements of the vehicle result that substantially do not run along the vehicle height axis. In other words, the surroundings data and vehicle component data comprise data from which movements of the vehicle result substantially along the vehicle longitudinal axis and substantially along the vehicle transverse axis, rolling movements (rotational movements about the vehicle longitudinal axis), pitching movements (rotational movements about the vehicle transverse axis) and yaw movements (rotational movements about the vehicle height axis).

If such surroundings data and vehicle component data that relate to all of the movements of the vehicle other than the movements of the vehicle that run substantially along the vehicle height axis are used to generate the seat adjustment signals, movements of the vehicle along the vehicle height axis are not counteracted by the vehicle seat system and the vehicle occupants experience the acceleration forces arising due to the movement substantially along the vehicle height axis. If a vehicle thus travels over bumpy ground, the vehicle seat system would not adjust the respective vehicle seat with respect to how the acceleration forces would act substantially along the vehicle height axis.

According to one embodiment, a vehicle is equipped with an embodiment of the above-described system for reducing motion sickness symptoms.

A second aspect of the invention relates to a method for reducing motion sickness symptoms, wherein the method comprises: receiving surroundings data and/or vehicle component data of a vehicle from which movements of the vehicle result. Generating seat adjustment signals and/or display signals depending on the received surroundings data and/or vehicle component data. Adjusting at least one vehicle seat of the vehicle in accordance with the seat adjustment signals and/or displaying the display signals.

Generating the seat adjustment signals comprises the following actions: determining first acceleration forces acting on a vehicle occupant sitting on a vehicle seat due to the movements of the vehicle using the surroundings data and/or vehicle component data; and determining seat adjustment signals that are designed such that they bring about second acceleration forces that counteract the first acceleration forces for the vehicle occupant after adjusting the vehicle seat in accordance with these seat adjustment signals.

Generating the display signals comprises the following actions: determining the acceleration forces actually acting on the vehicle occupant on the vehicle seat adjusted in accordance with the seat adjustment signals; and determining display signals that are designed such that they bring about a sensory perception, congruent with the actually acting acceleration forces, for the vehicle occupant on the vehicle seat adjusted in accordance with the seat adjustment signals.

The above explanations regarding the system according to the invention for reducing motion sickness symptoms according to the first aspect of the invention also apply analogously to the method according to the invention for reducing motion sickness symptoms according to the second aspect of the invention; advantageous exemplary embodiments of the method according to the invention correspond to the described advantageous exemplary embodiments of the system according to the invention. Advantageous exemplary embodiments of the method according to the invention that are not described explicitly at this point correspond to the described advantageous exemplary embodiments of the system according to the invention.

According to one embodiment, the method for reducing motion sickness symptoms furthermore comprises the following action: determining, using the received surroundings data and/or vehicle component data, whether the vehicle will have an unavoidable crash within a predefined duration and, in the event that the vehicle will have an unavoidable crash within the predefined duration, generating warning signals that are designed to warn the vehicle occupant about the crash.

According to a further embodiment, the method furthermore comprises the following action: monitoring whether a vehicle occupant is capable of perceiving a situation external to the vehicle, and generating seat adjustment signals and/or display signals only if it is established that the vehicle occupant is incapable. The displayed display signals are in this case visible in each case only to one vehicle occupant.

According to a further embodiment, the method furthermore comprises the following action: monitoring whether a vehicle occupant is capable of perceiving a situation external to the vehicle, and receiving seat adjustment signals and/or adjusting the vehicle seat and receiving display signals and/or displaying the display signals only if it is established that the vehicle occupant is incapable. The displayed display signals are in this case visible in each case only to one vehicle occupant.

The invention is described below with reference to exemplary embodiments, with the additional assistance of the attached drawings.

Technical Field

The present disclosure relates to a transmission apparatus, a preamble transmission apparatus and a transmission method.

Description of the Related Art

In Release 8 (Rel. 8) of 3GPP-LTE (3rd Generation Partnership Project Radio Access Network Long Term Evolution) (hereinafter may be simply referred to as “LTE”), OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) is employed as a downlink communication method, and SC-FDMA (single carrier frequency division multiple access) is employed as an uplink communication method.

In the Rel. 8 downlink, in order to demodulate a data signal (for example, a signal transmitted via a PDSCH), a CRS (cell specific reference signal) is used. In other words, the Rel. 8 downlink supports “CRS-used data transmission.” “CRS-used data transmission” refers to a transmission method in which a data signal is transmitted together with a CRS in a subframe with the CRS mapped therein, and during data reception, a terminal estimates a propagation channel according to the CRS and demodulates the data. A CRS is a reference signal to be transmitted over a full band in all subframes and is common within a given cell. Also, CRSs are mapped to time and frequency resources that depend on a cell ID, and for the CRSs, antenna ports 0 to 3 are used according to the number of transmission antennae. Also, CRSs are transmitted so as to cover all areas in a given cell. CRSs are also used for quality measurement, and results of the quality measurement are used for link adaptation or scheduling.

Meanwhile, Rel. 10, which is LTE-Advanced, supports “DMRS (demodulation reference signal)-used data transmission” in order to apply MIMO (multi-input multi-output) to downlink. “DMRS-used data transmission” refers to a transmission method in which a data signal is transmitted together with a DMRS in a subframe with a DMRS mapped therein, and during data reception, a terminal estimates a propagation channel according to the DMRS to demodulate the data. DMRS may be called “UE specific reference signal.” Also, while CRSs are transmitted to an entire cell, DMRSs are transmitted to a terminal to which a data resource for mapping a downlink data signal has been allocated, and transmitted only in a resource block (that is, a frequency resource) to which the data for the terminal has been allocated. When a data signal is transmitted to a predetermined terminal, a beam is formed by precoding, enabling data communication using the beam. Data communication using such beam provides a high throughput (see, for example, NPLs 1, 2, 3 and 4). Also, DMRS-used data transmission can be used for a terminal for which transmission mode 9 has been set. Also, antenna ports 7 to 14 are used according to the number of transmission antennae. Also, in Rel. 10, which is LTE-Advanced, CSI-RSs are used for quality measurement, and results of the quality measurement are used for link adaptation or scheduling.

Also, in Rel. 10, which is LTE-Advanced, a terminal for which transmission mode 9 has been set can also transmit a data signal in an “MBSFN (multi-broadcast single frequency network) subframe.”

Meanwhile, in Rel. 8, an “MBSFN subframe” is used for transmitting MBMS data (multicast or broadcast data) from a plurality of base stations to an SFN (single frequency network). Thus, resources in which a PDCCH signal and a CRS are mapped are limited to first two OFDM symbols in a subframe. Then, only MBMS data can be mapped in a third OFDM symbol from the head of the subframe and OFDM symbols subsequent to the third OFDM symbol. In other words, an MBSFN subframe contains no CRS in a third OFDM symbol from the head of the subframe or OFDM symbols subsequent to the third OFDM symbol (that is, data transmission region).

On the other hand, in Rel. 10, which is LTE-Advanced, DMRS-used data transmission (unicast data transmission) can be performed also in MBSFN subframes. As described above, an MBSFN subframe contains no CRS in the third OFDM symbol from the head of a subframe or OFDM symbols subsequent to the third OFDM symbol (that is, data transmission region), and thus, in Rel. 10, which is LTE-Advanced, more time and frequency resources can be used for PDSCH.

Also, for Rel. 11 (release following Rel. 10), which is LTE-Advanced, CoMP transmission, which provides coordinated transmission from a plurality of nodes, is being studied. Also, in the case where the CoMP transmission is used in a heterogeneous network environment, an operation using a cell ID that is the same as that of an HPN for a plurality of LPNs in a macro cell is being discussed (see, for example, NPL 6). In such operation, a common CRS is transmitted from an HPN and LPNs using a same cell ID. The term “heterogeneous network environment” refers to a network environment including a macro base station (HPN (high power node)) and pico base stations (LPN (low power nodes)).

Furthermore, an extension carrier (non-backward compatible carrier) for downlink is being studied for Rel. 11, which is LTE-Advanced. The extension carrier supports only DMRS, and no CRS is transmitted for overhead reduction (see, for example, NPL 7). As described above, the extension carrier enables highly efficient transmission by the operation that supports DMRS-used data transmission only.

Also, in LTE and LTE-Advanced, a terminal transmits an RACH (random access channel) to a base station when initial access is made, uplink data is generated during connection, or a handover is performed. Consequently, an attempt to establish connection from the terminal to the base station or to establish re-synchronization therebetween is made. A series of operations for the connection from the terminal to the base station or the establishment of re-synchronization therebetween is called “random access procedure.” “Random access procedure” includes the four steps indicated inFIG.1(see, for example, NPL 5).

Step 1 (transmission of message 1): A terminal randomly selects an RACH preamble resource to be actually used from a group of RACH preamble resource candidates (prescribed by combinations of time resources, frequency resources and sequence resources). Then, the terminal transmits an RACH preamble using the selected RACH preamble resource. Here, the selectable RACH preamble resource candidates are different depending on whether a propagation loss (path loss) between a base station and the terminal is not less than a predetermined threshold or is not greater than the predetermined threshold. The selectable RACH preamble resource candidates are also different depending on whether the data size is not less than a predetermined threshold or is not greater than the predetermined threshold. Also, an RACH preamble may be called “message 1.”

Step 2 (transmission of message 2): when a base station detects the RACH preamble, the base station transmits an RACH response (or a random access response). At this point of time, the base station cannot identify the terminal that has transmitted the RACH preamble. Thus, the RACH response is transmitted over the entire cell covered by the base station. A data resource in which the RACH response is mapped (that is, a PDSCH resource) is indicated by the base station to the terminal via a PDCCH. Also, the RACH response contains information relating to a resource to be used by the terminal in uplink or information relating to uplink transmission timing for the terminal. Here, if the terminal that has transmitted the RACH preamble receives no RACH response within a predetermined period of time from the transmission of the RACH preamble (that is, a retransmission determination period), the terminal performs RACH preamble resource selection and RACH preamble transmission (RACH retransmission) again.

Step 3 (transmission of message 3): the terminal transmits data such as an RRC connection request or a scheduling request using the uplink resource specified by the base station via the RACH response.

Step 4 (transmission of message 4): The base station transmits a message containing a UE-ID (for example, C-RNTI or temporary C-RNTI) assigned to the terminal, to the terminal to confirm that there is no contention between a plurality of terminals (contention resolution).

BRIEF SUMMARY

Technical Problem

As described above, the LTE-Advanced system provides highly efficient transmission by DMRS-used data transmission in MBSFN subframes and extension carriers, and CoMP transmission using a same cell ID.

However, “random access procedure” has the following problems.

(1) Problems relating to MBSFN subframe:

In one frame (=ten subframes), subframes with subframe numbers other than 0, 4, 5 and 9 can be set as MBSFN subframes. In other words, subframes with subframe numbers of 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8 are set as MBSFN subframes, enabling highly efficient system operation.

Here, in a non-MBSFN subframe, a CRS is mapped over the entire subframe, an RACH response can be transmitted by “CRS-used data transmission.” In other words, in a non-MBSFN subframe, even if an RACH response is transmitted by “CRS-used data transmission,” the terminal can receive the downlink data signal at a sufficiently low error rate.

On the other hand, in an MBSFN subframe, a CRS is mapped to only two OFDM symbols from the head of the subframe. Thus, with the MBSFN subframe, an error rate in RACH response reception increases.

Here, as described above, a terminal that supports Rel. 10, which is LTE-Advanced, can receive a DMRS. Thus, in Rel. 10, which is LTE-Advanced, an RACH response may be transmitted in an MBSFN subframe (see, for example, NPL 8).

However, if an RACH response is transmitted by “DMRS-used data transmission,” a release 10 compliant terminal can receive the RACH response, but a release 8 compliant terminal does not support DMRS and thus cannot receive the RACH response. Thus, even though the base station transmits an RACH response in an MBSFN subframe to a terminal that is the transmission source of the RACH preamble, if the transmission source terminal is a release 8 compliant terminal, the RACH response is not correctly received. Accordingly, the transmission source terminal re-transmits the RACH preamble. Thus, transmission of an RACH response by “DMRS-used data transmission” causes delay for release 8 compliant terminals. For this reason, in Rel. 10, an RACH response is transmitted using a CRS, and subframes in which an RACH response may be transmitted are limited to non-MBSFN subframes (seeFIG.2). However, limiting subframes used for transmission of an RACH response to non-MBSFN subframes results in delay of RACH response transmission. Also, shared channel signals to be transmitted by “CRS-used data transmission,” concentrate in non-MBSFN subframes. For this reason, a PDCCH region (that is, a common search space) used for indicating resources for mapping shared channel signals is congested. A shared channel signal that needs to be transmitted by “CRS-used data transmission” contains, e.g., an SIB (system information block), which is broadcast information, or paging information.

(2) Problems relating to extension carrier:

Provision of extension carriers enables an increase in capacity of resources. However, the extension carriers cannot be used for release 8 or release 10 compliant terminals. Thus, in transmission using a PDSCH during an RACH procedure, it is necessary to use normal component carriers. For this reason, normal component carriers are congested, which may result in delay in initial access or handover.

(3) Problems relating to CoMP transmission using same cell ID:

A common CRS is transmitted from all HPN and LPNs using the same cell ID. Thus, when CRS-used data transmission (that is, transmission of a PDSCH), the PDSCH is also transmitted from all transmission points (that is, all the HPN and the LPNs using the same cell ID). Accordingly, if data transmission using a CRS is employed for data transmission using a PDSCH during an RACH procedure, even for data transmission to a terminal located in the vicinity of a certain transmission point, the data is inefficiently transmitted from all the transmission points.

An object of the present disclosure to provide a transmission apparatus, a preamble transmission apparatus and a transmission method that achieve efficient response signal transmission.

Antiperspirants are personal hygiene products designed to control sweating and body odor. Antiperspirants contain ingredients that control sweat and body odor safely and effectively. When an antiperspirant is applied to the skin surface, its antiperspirant ingredients, e.g., aluminum salts, dissolve in the sweat or moisture on the skin. The dissolved substance forms a gel, which creates a small temporary plug near the top of the sweat gland, significantly reducing the amount of sweat that is secreted to the skin surface. Antiperspirant actives may also flocculate proteins present in the sweat to form a precipitate which blocks the sweat glands. Although antiperspirants reduce sweating, they do not impact on the natural ability of the body to control its temperature.

It has been known that zirconium salts exhibit effective antiperspirant properties such zirconium compounds include acidic zirconium salts such as zirconium oxychloride or zirconyl chloride, zirconium hydroxychloride, and other halide and sulfate substitutes of the salts. Due to the large charge to size ratio of Zr4+, zirconium compounds provide superior sweat reduction efficacy but has a high skin irritation potential. According to FDA antiperspirant over-the-counter monograph, zirconium compounds may be added into polymerized aluminum chloride systems to produce aluminum zirconium chlorohydrates, optionally comprising glycine. The zirconium salts are extremely acidic and irritating to the skin. For example, a solution of zirconium oxychloride which is effective as an antiperspirant has a pH of about 0.8. Thus, zirconium oxychloride alone cannot be used in a topical product due to its extremely low pH value. Moreover, decreasing the acidity of zirconium compounds using weak acids, e.g., organic acids, tends to decrease their antiperspirant efficacy.

There is a need for partially neutralized zirconium compounds that overcome the undesirable effects of highly acidic zirconium compounds and at the same time exhibit desirable properties as antiperspirant/deodorant actives or water treatment agents.

BRIEF SUMMARY

Field

This application is related to viewing optics assemblies, and more specifically to viewing optics assembly architectures configured to utilize very high refractive index lightguide substrates. The viewing optics assemblies can be used in optical systems, including augmented reality imaging and visualization systems.

Description of the Related Art

Modern computing and display technologies have facilitated the development of systems for so called “virtual reality” or “augmented reality” experiences, in which digitally reproduced images or portions thereof are presented to a user in a manner wherein they seem to be, or may be perceived as, real. A virtual reality, or “VR”, scenario typically involves the presentation of digital or virtual image information without transparency to other actual real-world visual input; an augmented reality, or “AR”, scenario typically involves presentation of digital or virtual image information as an augmentation to visualization of the actual world around the user. A mixed reality, or “MR”, scenario is a type of AR scenario and typically involves virtual objects that are integrated into, and responsive to, the natural world. For example, an MR scenario may include AR image content that appears to be blocked by or is otherwise perceived to interact with objects in the real world.

Referring toFIG.1, an augmented reality scene10is depicted. The user of an AR technology sees a real-world park-like setting20featuring people, trees, buildings in the background, and a concrete platform30. The user also perceives that he/she “sees” “virtual content” such as a robot statue40standing upon the real-world platform30, and a flying cartoon-like avatar character50which seems to be a personification of a bumble bee. These elements50,40are “virtual” in that they do not exist in the real world. Because the human visual perception system is complex, it is challenging to produce AR technology that facilitates a comfortable, natural-feeling, rich presentation of virtual image elements amongst other virtual or real-world imagery elements.

Systems and methods disclosed herein address various challenges related to AR and VR technology.

SUMMARY

A head mounted display system may be configured to project light to an eye of a user to display augmented reality image content in a vision field of the user. The head-mounted display system may include a frame that is configured to be supported on a head of the user. The head-mounted display system may also include an eyepiece disposed on the frame. At least a portion of the eyepiece may be transparent and/or disposed at a location in front of the user's eye when the user wears the head-mounted display such that the transparent portion transmits light from the environment in front of the user to the user's eye to provide a view of that environment in front of the user. The eyepiece may include one or more waveguides disposed to direct light into the user's eye to form augmented reality image content.

Various embodiments of the head mounted display system comprise at least one projector having one or more pupils that output light (e.g., image light) having a plurality of colors or ranges of wavelengths (e.g., two or three colors or ranges of wavelengths) to produce different color images or image components such as red image components, green image components and blue image components. Such images components can be combined to provide virtually full color imagery. These color components can be directed into the eye of the user to display augmented reality or virtual image content. In some implementations, the eyepiece in the head mounted display system comprising a waveguide assembly comprising a plurality of waveguides stacked over each other.

In various implementations of display devices contemplated in this application include one or more waveguides comprising materials with refractive index greater than refractive index of glass. For example, one or more waveguides in various embodiments of display devices contemplated in this application can comprise Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) or silicon carbide (SiC). In various embodiments, one or more waveguides in various embodiments of display devices contemplated in this application can comprise materials that are transparent to visible light and have a refractive index greater than refractive index of glass (e.g., refractive index greater than or equal to about 1.79). One or more waveguides comprising materials with relatively high refractive index (e.g., refractive index greater than refractive index of glass and/or refractive index greater than or equal to about 1.79) can advantageously enlarge the field of view of the image content from the projector(s) that is output to the user's eye by the one or more waveguides as compared to waveguides comprising glass and/or materials with refractive index less than about 1.79. Advantageously, in various implementations of display devices, multiple colors or wavelengths of light (e.g., red, green and/or blue wavelengths of light) can be concurrently in-coupled into and guided within a single waveguide comprising materials with relatively high refractive index (e.g., refractive index greater than refractive index of glass and/or refractive index greater than or equal to about 1.79) and be and out-coupled therefrom with similar angular output for each color or wavelength into the user's eye. Accordingly, as opposed to using three waveguides, for example, one for each of three colors (e.g., red, green, and blue), a single waveguide may be employed to propagate three color components of images from the projector(s). Such reduction in the number of waveguides may potentially have one or more advantage such as for example reducing weight, overall eyepiece thickness, complexity, form factor and/or increase optical transmission and/or image quality.

In some implementations, instead of three colors, two colors components of the image content from the projector(s) can be in-coupled into and guided within a single waveguide and out-coupled to the user's eye. In some such designs, two waveguides may be used to accommodate three colors. For example, a first waveguide can receive and guide therein two colors (e.g., red and green, red and blue, or green and blue), and the second waveguide can receive, guide and output to the user the third color (e.g., blue, green, and red, respectively). In some implementations, a first waveguide can receive and guide therein two colors (e.g., red and green, red and blue, green and blue), and the second waveguide can receive, guide and output to the viewer a single third color or color components (e.g., blue, green, and red, respectively). In other implementations, a first waveguide can receive and guide therein two colors (e.g., red and green), and the second waveguide can receive, guide and out-couple to the viewer two color or color components wherein one of the color components is different than the image color components (e.g., green and blue) guided in the first waveguide. Using two waveguides, instead of three (e.g., per depth or depth plane), still may reduce thickness, complexity and potentially provide one or more of the advantages discussed herein.

Likewise, different waveguides in the plurality of waveguides may include an in-coupling optical element configured to in-couple light of one of the colors or plurality of ranges of wavelengths from the light outputted from the pupil of the projector(s). In some implementations, for example, a single in-coupling optical element in a waveguide is used to couple three colors or color components into the waveguide to be guided therein. In some implementations, a single in-coupling optical element in a waveguide is used to couple two colors or color components into the waveguide to be guided therein. In other implementations, different in-coupling optical elements are used to couple respective different colors or color components into a single waveguide to be guided therein. For example, three in-coupling optical elements may be used to couple three respective colors or color components into single waveguide. Similarly, two in-coupling optical elements may be used to couple two respective colors or color components into single waveguide.

Accordingly, in one or more implementations, two or more colors (e.g., two or three colors) can be coupled into a single waveguide comprising materials with relatively high refractive index (e.g., refractive index greater than refractive index of glass and/or refractive index greater than or equal to about 1.79) using one or more in-coupling optical elements such that the incoupled two or more colors can propagate within the single waveguide comprising materials with relatively high refractive index (e.g., refractive index greater than refractive index of glass and/or refractive index greater than or equal to about 1.79) via total-internal reflection and be out-coupled to the viewer for to present virtual image content. In some implementations, a single in-coupling optical element can be configured to receive light of two or more colors containing image information from an imaging system (e.g., a projection device) and in-couple the received light of two or more colors containing image information into a single waveguide comprising materials with relatively high refractive index (e.g., refractive index greater than refractive index of glass and/or refractive index greater than or equal to about 1.79) such that the light of two or more colors containing image information propagates through the single waveguide by total internal reflection and be out-coupled to the viewer for to present virtual image content. In some implementations, two or more in-coupling optical elements can be configured to receive light of two or more colors containing image information from an imaging system (e.g., a projection device) and in-couple the received light of two or more colors containing image information into a single waveguide comprising materials with relatively high refractive index (e.g., refractive index greater than refractive index of glass and/or refractive index greater than or equal to about 1.79) such that the light of two or more colors containing image information propagates through the single waveguide by total internal reflection and be out-coupled to the viewer for to present virtual image content. The one or more in-coupling optical elements can be aligned with one or more exit pupils of the projector or imaging system that emits the light of two or more colors containing image information.

Volumetric video uses a plurality of cameras to capture up to a 360 degree field of view of a scene. Unlike traditional 360 degree video that is used for applications like virtual reality, gaming, and the like, however, volumetric video is captured from the outside, in. When viewing a volumetric video scene, a viewer may view the scene from any angle (including the middle of the scene), may zoom in or out of the scene, or may view the scene from different perspectives within the scene. The scene may also be viewed in two or three dimensions (e.g., using traditional two-dimensional television displays, three dimensional television displays, head mounted displays, and the like). As such, volumetric video techniques may be used to enhance the viewing experience of live events, such as concerts and sporting events, by making the experience more immersive.

SUMMARY

The present disclosure describes a device, computer-readable medium, and method for selecting spectator viewpoints in volumetric video presentations of live events. In one example, a method includes receiving a plurality of video streams depicting an event occurring in a venue, wherein the plurality of video streams is provided to a processor by a plurality of cameras which are geographically distributed within the venue, identifying an initial position of a target that is present in the venue, based on an analysis of the plurality of video streams, compositing the plurality of video streams to produce a first volumetric video traversal of the live event that follows the target through the venue, predicting a future position of the target in the venue at a future point in time, based in part on a current position of the target, and sending an alert to a display device that is streaming a volumetric video presentation of the event, wherein the alert indicates the future position of the target.

In another example, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium stores instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations. The operations include receiving a plurality of video streams depicting an event occurring in a venue, wherein the plurality of video streams is provided to a processor by a plurality of cameras which are geographically distributed within the venue, identifying an initial position of a target that is present in the venue, based on an analysis of the plurality of video streams, compositing the plurality of video streams to produce a first volumetric video traversal of the live event that follows the target through the venue, predicting a future position of the target in the venue at a future point in time, based in part on a current position of the target, and sending an alert to a display device that is streaming a volumetric video presentation of the event, wherein the alert indicates the future position of the target.

In another example, a system includes a processor deployed in a telecommunication service provider network and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium stores instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations.

This Application is a Section 371 National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT/FR2020/050259, filed Feb. 13, 2020, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety and published as WO 2020/183080 A1 on Sep. 17, 2020, not in English.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The field of the invention is that of digital multimedia content, specifically digital audio and/or video content, also called audiovisual content. The invention relates more particularly to a method for managing the display of images associated with image jumps liable to be implemented during accelerated playback of multimedia content.

In the present text, accelerated playback targets both rewinding and fast-forwarding for implementing image jumps in multimedia content.

An item of content is for example television-on-demand content, video-on-demand content, etc.

Prior Art

There are nowadays many audiovisual content rendering terminals allowing a user to access multimedia content such as video on demand. These rendering terminals are designed to receive this digital content in the form of multimedia data and to render it to the user. This rendering consists in delivering, via the terminal, the digital content in a form that is accessible to the user. For example, received data corresponding to a video are generally decoded and then rendered via the terminal in the form of a display of the corresponding video with its associated soundtrack. The display may take place on a screen of the rendering terminal itself or on a remote screen associated therewith. Such multimedia content rendering terminals are more often than not able to be controlled remotely by the user by way of remote control devices, and in particular remote controls. A remote control offers multiple commands able to be executed by the rendering terminal. The purpose of commands is for example to fast-forward (>>) or to rewind (<<). These commands make it possible to act on the rendering of the digital content and in particular to accelerate the rendering of the content on the screen. When accelerating playback, some images (also called thumbnails) of the content are displayed on the screen. The thumbnail thus displayed allows a user in particular to find his bearings in the content when accelerating playback.

It should be noted that the user may activate the fast-forward/rewind function in a manner other than by way of a remote control. The fast-forward/rewind function may also be activated via an application dedicated to the management of the multimedia stream player when the latter is associated with a client terminal, such as for example a tablet or a smartphone. The functions may also be present on the rendering device through buttons that are present on the rendering device.

The accelerations that are traditionally used nowadays multiply the playback speed by two (×2), by four (×4), by sixteen (×16), by thirty-two (×32) or even sixty-four (×64). Thus, when a user is for example watching a video, he has the option of moving quickly to a precise point thereof by accelerating rendering thereof by activating the fast-forward/rewind function.

These accelerations result in a number of image jumps in the content that depends on the chosen acceleration speed. The chosen speed determines new playback times following the acceleration, and respective images extracted from the content to be rendered on the screen.

One problem is that the time to download the image, the image associated with the new playback time resulting from a jump, may be lengthy. This download time is all the lengthier when the image is contained in an image segment and the downloading of the image requires the downloading of the associated segment. Such a segment is used for example when multimedia content is received in adaptive streaming mode. Indeed, the MPEG-DASH (for “Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP”) standard is an audiovisual broadcasting format standard for broadcasting over the Internet; this standard is based on preparing the content in various presentations of variable quality and bit rate, divided into segments of a short duration (of the order of a few seconds), also called “chunks” by those skilled in the art. Each of these segments is made available individually by way of an exchange protocol between the rendering terminal and the multimedia content provider server. The protocol that is mainly targeted is the HTTP protocol, but other protocols (for example FTP) may also be used. The organization of the segments and the associated parameters are published in a manifest in XML format.

Ultimately, the display of an image representative of a jump includes at least the following durations:a duration to load the segment,a duration linked to the extraction of an image from the segment,and a duration to render this segment.

The addition of these durations may unfortunately be greater than the period between two jumps, in particular when the bit rate on the network that is used is low; this is often the case with an ADSL network. It follows that the chosen acceleration, for example the (×64) acceleration, is intentionally reduced so as to render each image correctly. In addition, this reduction in the acceleration speed takes place without the user's knowledge. This solution is unacceptable in terms of quality of service.

The invention offers a solution that does not have the drawbacks of the prior art.

The Invention

To this end, according to one functional aspect, one subject of the invention is a method for managing the display of images associated with image jumps liable to be implemented during accelerated playback of multimedia content on a rendering device, the content being able to be downloaded from a communication network, characterized in that at least one image associated with a jump is downloaded in advance.

According to the invention, an image associated with a jump (also called thumbnail in the present application) is downloaded before the execution of a command to play back this image. During accelerated playback, the method comprises displaying successive images, loaded in advance, representative of the state of progress of the accelerated playback in the content.

It will be seen hereinafter that, if multiple images are downloaded in advance, these images may be downloaded in a single message or downloaded in succession. The choice may depend on the number of images to be downloaded.

The advance downloading of an image associated with a jump makes it possible to provision images before and/or during the phase of playing back the content and may therefore be used subsequently during accelerated playback of the content without requiring downloading. The duration linked to the playback of a thumbnail is then reduced to the duration of playing back the image stored in the memory of the rendering device, this image having been downloaded in advance and therefore stored in memory, ready to be played back.

The proposed solution aims to anticipate the loading of images that will be displayed when accelerating playback of the multimedia content. It will be seen hereinafter that the image may be contained in an image segment. The advance loading makes it possible to anticipate the loading of the segment and the extraction of the image from the segment; The display duration is then reduced to the duration linked to the rendering of the image stored in a memory of the rendering terminal. In this way, even if the bit rate on the communication network is low, the invention ensures that the acceleration applied to the playback of the content will actually be the selected acceleration.

According to a first embodiment, the playback step is preceded by a step of receiving the content from a communication network; in this configuration, the advance download is performed when the bit rate on the network is less than a given bit rate. This first embodiment avoids implementing the method of the invention when this is not necessary.

According to a second embodiment, which may be implemented as an alternative or in addition to the previous one, an image stored in advance is stored in a memory, and in that it is erased from the memory when the playback of the content is stopped. This second embodiment has the advantage of optimizing the memory space in the rendering terminal. The stop in question indifferently targets a final stop, a pause, or any other function for stopping or ending playback of multimedia content.

According to a third embodiment, which may be implemented as an alternative or in addition to the previous ones, an image stored in advance is stored in a memory; and is erased from the memory after a given number of playbacks of this image. Just like the first embodiment, this second embodiment has the advantage of optimizing the memory space in the rendering terminal by erasing the thumbnail when it has been played back a number N (N is an integer) of times, for example just once. This third embodiment also avoids new downloading of images in advance when the content is intended to be played back multiple times. In this configuration, N is strictly greater than 1. For example, if N is set to 2, the image downloaded in advance may be played back twice from memory.

According to a fourth embodiment, which may be implemented as an alternative or in addition to the previous ones, the images stored in advance are stored in a memory; and are then retained in the memory for a given duration. This third embodiment has the advantage, in particular if the content is intended to be replayed, of subsequently having images that are loaded in advance, and therefore avoids having to reload the images in advance when this same content is accessed subsequently.

According to a fifth embodiment, which may be implemented as an alternative or in addition to the previous ones, if the image to be displayed is contained in an image segment, the image chosen from the segment is an intra image.

According to a sixth embodiment, which may be implemented as an alternative or in addition to the previous ones, the advance loading step is performed after a waiting period. This sixth embodiment takes into consideration a user's right to repent, who may decide not to view the content, for example after a few seconds of rendering. This embodiment avoids downloading segments in advance when the user decides to stop the rendering of the content a short time after the start of rendering.

According to a seventh embodiment, which may be implemented as an alternative or in addition to the previous ones, when playback is scheduled for a given date, the advance loading step is performed before the given date. This embodiment avoids downloading images in advance during playback of the content. This embodiment optimizes the use of bandwidth. More generally, the advance downloading of the thumbnails as a background task will preferably be such that it does not alter the quality of the current playback of the content. The thumbnails (in reality the segments that contain the images) will be downloaded at a controlled rate that does not interfere with the recovery of the segments of the stream currently being played back.

According to one hardware aspect, the invention relates to a management entity for managing the display of images associated with image jumps liable to be implemented during accelerated playback of the content, the content being able to be downloaded from a communication network, characterized in that it comprises a download module able to download at least one image associated with a jump in advance. According to another hardware aspect, the invention relates to a decoder comprising a management entity as defined above.

According to another hardware aspect, the invention relates to a computer program able to be implemented on an entity as defined above, the program comprising code instructions that, when it is executed by a processor, performs the steps of the selection method that are defined above.

Finally, according to another hardware aspect, the invention relates to a data medium on which at least one sequence of program code instructions for executing a management method as defined above has been stored.

Such a recording medium may be any entity or device capable of storing the program. For example, the medium may contain a storage means, such as a ROM, for example a CD-ROM or a microelectronic circuit ROM, or else a magnetic recording means, for example a USB key or a hard drive.

On the other hand, such a recording medium may be a transmissible medium such as an electrical or optical signal, which may be routed via an electrical or optical cable, by radio or by other means, such that the computer program that it contains is able to be executed remotely. The program according to the invention may in particular be downloaded from a network, for example the Internet.

As an alternative, the recording medium may be an integrated circuit in which the program is incorporated, the circuit being designed to execute or to be used in the execution of the abovementioned display control method.

The invention will be better understood on reading the following description, which is given by way of example and with reference to the appended drawings, in which:

The present disclosure generally relates to the field of identifying temporary dynamic obstructions, associated methods and apparatus, and in particular concerns, for example, an apparatus configured to provide a map layer of one or more temporary dynamic obstructions based on vehicle/driver behavior data and contextual data.

BACKGROUND

Obstructions within a road network may hinder visibility of vehicle operators, thereby increasing likelihood of accidents and heavy traffic within the road network. Image sensing devices may be provided within the road network for detecting obstructions and notifying local establishment to deploy field personnel for removing such obstructions. However, performing image analysis for detecting obstructions within images and constant use of image sensing devices are resource intensive. Further, image analysis is also subject to error, and as such, image sensing devices may incorrectly notify existence of obstructions within the road network.

The listing or discussion of a prior-published document or any background in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document or background is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.

BRIEF SUMMARY

According to a first aspect, an apparatus including at least one processor and at least one non-transitory memory including computer program code instructions is described. The computer program code instructions are configured to, when executed, cause the apparatus to receive vehicle behavior data associated with a vehicle at a portion of a road, determine a likelihood of a temporary dynamic obstruction existing proximate to the portion based on the vehicle behavior data, and update a datapoint of a map layer based on the likelihood. The datapoint indicates a state of existence of the temporary dynamic obstruction at the portion.

According to a second aspect, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer program code instructions stored therein is described. The computer program code instructions, when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to receive driver behavior data associated with one or more vehicles at or proximate to an intersection. The computer program code instructions, when executed by at least one processor, further cause the at least one processor to, responsive to the driver behavior data indicating existence of a temporary dynamic obstruction at or proximate to the intersection, validate the existence by receiving and analyzing contextual data associated with the intersection. The contextual data are image data associated with the intersection, weather data associated with the intersection, or a combination thereof. The computer program code instructions, when executed by at least one processor, further cause the at least one processor to, responsive to the contextual data validating the existence, update a datapoint of a map layer to indicate that the temporary dynamic obstruction exists at or proximate to the intersection.

According to a third aspect, a method of updating a map layer of one or more temporary dynamic obstructions is described. The method includes receiving driver behavior data associated with one or more vehicles at or proximate to an intersection and updating a confidence value indicating a likelihood of a temporary dynamic obstruction existing at or proximate to the intersection based on the driver behavior data and a frequency at which the driver behavior data are received. The method further includes, responsive to the confidence value being equal to or greater than a threshold value, creating a datapoint within the map layer, wherein the datapoint indicates existence of the temporary dynamic obstruction at or proximate to the intersection. The method further includes, subsequent to creating the datapoint, responsive to the confidence value being lower than a threshold value, removing the datapoint from the map layer.

Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to an organic electroluminescence device, more particularly, relates to an organic electroluminescence device having a hole injection layer doped with a p-type conductive material, and a display assembly.

BACKGROUND

Organic electroluminescence devices (OLED) convert electrical energy into light by applying voltages across the device. Generally, one organic electroluminescence device includes an anode, a cathode and an organic layer disposed between the anode and the cathode. The organic layer of the electroluminescent device includes a hole injection layer, a hole transporting layer, an electron blocking layer, a light-emitting layer (including a host material and a doped material), an electron buffer layer, a hole blocking layer, an electron transporting layer, and an electron injection layer. According to different material functions, materials that consist of the organic layer can be divided into hole injection materials, hole transporting materials, electron blocking materials, host materials, light-emitting materials, electron buffer materials, hole blocking materials, electron transporting materials, and hole blocking materials. When a bias voltage is applied to the device, holes are injected from the anode to the light-emitting layer, and electrons are injected from the cathode to the light-emitting layer. The holes and electrons meet each other to form excitons, and the excitons recombine and emit light.

The hole injection layer can be a single-material layer, or can be a multiple-material layer. The multiple-material layer generally utilizes a hole transporting layer material doped with a certain proportion of p-type conductive doped material. The doping proportion is usually lower than 5%, and the most commonly used doping proportion is between 1% and 3%. The p-type doping effect can be achieved through the strong electron-capturing ability of the p-type conductive doped material, which improves hole injection and conductivity. Such hole injection layer doped with the p-type conductive material has been widely used, because it usually has a lower voltage than a single layer material. The LUMO energy level of commonly used p-type conductive materials is about −5.1 eV, so such materials can be matched with hole transporting materials whose HOMO energy level is about −5.1 eV. However, there are a variety of hole transporting materials in the industry nowadays, including those whose HOMO energy level is −5.2 eV or deeper. However, p-type conductive materials whose LUMO energy level is −5.1 eV or more shallow may not be able to effectively match hole transporting materials whose HOMO energy level is −5.2 eV or deeper to achieve the p-type doping effect. Therefore, in order to promote the widespread application of p-type doping technology, it is necessary to develop and utilize p-type conductive doped materials whose LUMO energy level is deeper than −5.1 eV. On the other hand, in OLED devices, the HOMO energy level of the host material of most light-emitting layers is around −5.4 eV to −5.6 eV, much deeper than that of the hole transporting layer material, causing holes to encounter a high barrier when they enter the light-emitting layer from the transporting layer. In order to solve this problem, an electron blocking layer (or called a second hole transporting layer) whose HOMO energy level is between the HOMO energy level of the hole transporting layer and the HOMO energy level of the light-emitting layer is usually inserted between the hole transporting layer and the light-emitting layer, that is, a first hole transporting layer and a second hole transporting layer are established between the hole injection layer and the light-emitting layer to form a structure in which potential energy shows a progressive change. However, the hole injection in such structure still faces a large total barrier height from the HOMO energy level of the first hole transporting layer to the HOMO energy level of the host material of the light-emitting layer, and the addition of an extra material also brings more interface defects, thereby affecting the lifetime and increasing the complexity of the process. Therefore, if a hole transporting material whose HOMO energy level is deeper can be used as the only hole transporting material layer between the hole injection layer and the light-emitting layer, not only the potential barrier that holes are faced with from the hole injection layer to the light-emitting layer can be reduced, but also an extra material can be dispensed with. Furthermore, if the same hole transporting material with deep HOMO energy level is also used in the hole injection layer and is doped with a p-type conductive doped material whose LUMO energy level is matched with that of such hole transporting material, the combination of both materials can reduce the total potential barrier for hole injection and avoid of utilization of simple and effective devices which use multiple hole transporting materials.

It is relatively common to use organic materials with deep HOMO energy levels as transporting materials in OLED devices. For example, the compound,


whose HOMO energy level is −5.28 eV, was disclosed as a hole transporting layer material in JP2009076817A, as an electron blocking layer material in WO2013129835A1, and as a host material in US20150364696A1. The compound,

Finally, interfaces and the generation of interface defects are reduced due to the reduction of one material, and the lifetime of the device is also improved.

This patent application is the U.S. National Stage entry under 35 U.S.C. § 371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/FR2020/050677, filed on Apr. 21, 2020, which claims the benefit of priority to French Patent Application No. 1904919, filed on May 13, 2019.

DOMAIN TECHNIQUE

The present disclosure relates to the field of turbomachines, and relates more precisely to a deicing system of a turbomachine cone, and the associated method.

PRIOR ART

Turbomachines employed on aircraft commonly have a cone positioned at the upstream end, at the air inlet into the turbomachine.

However, during flight under icing conditions, there is a risk of ice accumulating on this cone. Such an accumulation of ice poses a double problem. In fact, too great an accumulate of ice can undesirably modify the mass and the aerodynamic properties of the front cone. Moreover, in the event of a sudden release of a mass of ice accumulated on the cone, the ice thus released can be ingested by the turbomachine, which is likely to damage it.

One known solution consists of extracting a flow of hot air in the turbomachine, and creating a circulation of this flow of hot air in an internal cavity of the cone. It is however easily understood that such an extraction of hot air in the turbomachine will impact its efficiency, and cause an increase in the fuel consumption, which is very penalizing. Moreover, the transfer of a flow of air between components having a high relative rotation speed causes a problem for providing sealing between these components.

One alternative known solution consists of using an electrical anti-icing system including heating elements located on the internal wall of the cone of the turbomachine and supplied by an electrical power source. This alternative solution, however, has several problems. In the case of a rotating front cone, the need for dissipated heat power evolves depending on the speed at which air arrives on the cone, which is linked to the speed of the low-pressure shaft. This need evolves within a range bounded by a minimum value and a maximum value. In fact, the dissipated power must be sufficient to ensure a suitable anti-icing level of the front cone. However, the dissipated power must not lead to a temperature in excess of the maximum allowable by the materials of the front cone, to avoid loss of the mechanical characteristics of these materials. The mechanical power used by the anti-icing system is preferably extracted directly on the engine in order to ensure autonomy of the system with respect to the airplane electrical network. This electrical power is supplied by an electrical generator mechanically linked to a shaft of the turbojet, either by a direct outlet or through a gearbox. The prior art on a turbojet consists of extracting the energy from a single gearbox connected to a high-pressure shaft. Thus, the need for dissipated thermal power evolves depending on the speed of the low-pressure shaft of the turbojet, while the available electrical power evolves depending on the speed of the high-pressure shaft of the turbojet. However, the speeds of the low-pressure shaft and of the high-pressure shaft are distinct speeds that evolve independently depending on the flight phase, the environment, the wear of the turbojet and transient conditions.

One problem is therefore the feasibility of a control mode of the heating elements which allows ensuring both a suitable level of anti-icing of the front cone and the observance of the maximum allowable temperature of the materials of the cone regardless of the speed excursion of the high and low pressure shafts over all the operating points of the turbojet.

The present disclosure thus seeks to respond at least partially to these problems.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION

To this end, the present disclosure relates to a turbomachine comprising a stator, a high-pressure shaft, a low-pressure shaft, each movable in rotation with respect to the stator, and a cone positioned at an upstream end of the turbomachine in the direction of the air flow and secured in rotation to the low-pressure shaft, the turbomachine comprising a system for deicing said cone, comprising resistive heating elements positioned on an internal wall of said cone, an energy transfer system between said resistive heating elements and a stator of the turbomachine, the cone being movable in rotation with respect to the stator, an electrical power source coupled to the high-pressure shaft and connected to the energy transfer system by a set of switches, a computer, the computer being configured so as to define a power set point for deicing the cone depending on ambient temperature and pressure data, and on an operating speed of the low-pressure shaft, and so, depending on the electrical power supplied by the electrical power source, to define a duty cycle of the set of switches to deliver electrical power to the resistive heating elements.

According to one example, the computer is configured so as to determine the electrical power supplied by the electrical power source depending on an operating speed of the high-pressure shaft of the turbomachine.

According to one example, the turbomachine also comprises a power sensor positioned between the set of switches and the energy transfer system, adapted to supply information to the computer regarding the power delivered to the energy transfer system.

The turbomachine then typically comprises an estimator, configured, depending on the operating speed of the high-pressure shaft and on the duty cycle determined by the computer, to determine a theoretical power dissipated by the resistive heating elements, and a diagnostic unit, configured to compare the theoretical dissipated power determined by the computer and the power delivered to the energy transfer system measured by the power sensor, and, if the deviation between the theoretical dissipated power determined by the computer and the power delivered to the energy transfer system measured by the power sensor is greater than or equal to a threshold value, to deliver an error signal to a user.

According to one example, the energy transfer system is a rotating transformer, comprising a movable assembly secured in rotation to the cone, and a fixed assembly secured to the stator.

According to one example, the one electrical power source is a permanent-magnet alternator coupled to the high-pressure shaft.

The present disclosure also relates to an aircraft comprising a turbomachine as previously defined.

The present disclosure also relates to a method for deicing an upstream cone of a turbomachine, in which a required deicing power set point is defined depending on the ambient temperature and pressure conditions of the cone and a rotation speed of the cone (which corresponds to the speed of a low-pressure shaft of the turbomachine, the cone being secured to the low-pressure shaft), a duty cycle of a set of switches is defined depending on the electrical power supplied by an electrical power source coupled to a high-pressure shaft of the turbomachine, said set of switches is controlled by means of the duty cycle so as to deliver electrical power to resistive heating elements positioned in the cone via an energy transfer system between said resistive heating elements and a stator of the turbomachine.

According to one example, the electrical power supplied by the electrical power source is determined depending on the rotation speed of the high-pressure shaft of the turbomachine.

According to one example, the electrical power supplied by the electrical power source is determined by means of a power sensor supplying information regarding the power delivered to the energy transfer system.

11977431	"BACKGROUND

Cloud computing has impacted how enterprises manage computing needs by cost-effectively providing reliable, flexible, scalable, and redundant computing resources. For instance, cloud computing enables an enterprise to manage its information technology needs without, for example, traditional capital investment and maintenance considerations encountered with managing and maintaining computer equipment. In addition, as more and more computing shifts to cloud systems, the capabilities of these cloud systems to store, process, and output data have increased to levels that were once were likely unimaginable.

An effect of this shift to cloud systems is that memory errors that occur in the cloud systems, if not contained and/or recovered from, can impact customer and user experiences on a scale corresponding to an enterprise's footprint on the cloud. For instance, it is not untypical that detecting an uncorrectable memory error on a host leads to shutting down the host, resulting in the abrupt termination of all virtual machines (VMs) and applications hosted by the host. With cloud systems having memory sizes on the gigabyte or terabyte-scale, such memory errors may affect large numbers of VMs and applications, resulting in significant downtime and data loss, and poor customer approval.

When a physical memory experiences a memory fault, e.g., an “uncorrectable error,” other yet undetected memory errors typically exist and that memory is likely “permanently” damaged. In such cases, migration of VMs while retaining their operational status can reduce downtime while containing the number and severity of memory error propagation.

BRIEF SUMMARY

Aspects of the disclosed technology may comprise methods or systems implemented in a cloud computing environment that allow for proactive detection, containment (e.g., preventing corrupted data from propagating to a target host in a migration), and recovery from uncorrectable memory errors.

An aspect of the disclosure is directed to a method for proactively detecting memory errors in a cloud computing environment. The method may comprise scanning, by a scanner of a host machine, memory of the host machine for errors; detecting, by the scanner, a memory error in the memory of the host machine; generating, by one or more processors of the host machine, a machine check exception (MCE); and providing, by the one or more processors, the MCE to a kernel executing on the host machine.

In some instances, the scanning is continuously performed by the scanner. In some examples, the scanning is read-only scanning. In some examples, the memory error is an uncorrectable memory error. In some examples, the MCE includes an indication of the location of the memory where the memory error was detected by the scanner.

In some instances, the method further includes based on the location of the memory where the memory error was detected by the scanner, identifying one or more memory pages determined to be associated with the memory error as one or more poisoned memory pages.

In some instances, the method further includes isolating the one or more poisoned memory pages from access by the host machine.

In some examples, the method further comprises receiving a page fault associated with a read request made by a guest of a virtual machine executing on the host machine; and transmitting, by the kernel, a SIGBUS signal to a hypervisor of the virtual machine.

In some examples, the method further comprises generating, by the hypervisor, a machine check exception; and transmitting the machine check exception to the guest.

Another aspect of the technology is directed to a system. The system may comprise a host machine capable of supporting one or more virtual machines; and one or more processing devices coupled to a memory containing instructions. The instructions may cause the one or more processing devices to: scan memory of the host machine for errors; detect a memory error in the memory of the host machine; generate a machine check exception (MCE); and transmit the MCE to the kernel of host machine, the MCE including information associated with the memory error.

In some instances, the scanning is continuously performed by the scanner. In some examples, the scanning is read-only scanning. In some examples, the memory error is an uncorrectable memory error. In some examples, the MCE includes an indication of the location of the memory where the memory error was detected by the scanner.

In some examples, the instructions further cause the one or more processors to: based on the location of the memory where the memory error was detected, identify one or more memory pages determined to be associated with the memory error as one or more poisoned memory pages.

In some examples, the instructions further cause the one or more processors to isolate the one or more poisoned memory pages from access by the host machine.

In some examples, the instructions further cause the one or more processors to receive a page fault associated with a read request made by a guest of a virtual machine executing on the host machine; and transmit a SIGBUS signal to a hypervisor of the virtual machine.

In some examples, the instructions further cause the one or more processors to generate a machine check exception; and transmit the machine check exception to the guest.

Another aspect of the disclosure is directed to a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions, that when executed by one or more processors cause the one or more processors to: scan memory of the host machine for errors; detect a memory error in the memory of the host machine; generate a machine check exception (MCE); and transmit the MCE to the kernel of host machine, the MCE including information associated with the memory error.

11888742	"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

Aspects of the present disclosure generally relate to wireless communication and to techniques and apparatuses for extended routing identifiers for integrated access and backhaul (IAB).

BACKGROUND

Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various telecommunication services such as telephony, video, data, messaging, and broadcasts. Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

A wireless network may include one or more base stations that support communication for a user equipment (UE) or multiple UEs. A UE may communicate with a base station via downlink communications and uplink communications. “Downlink” (or “DL”) refers to a communication link from the base station to the UE, and “uplink” (or “UL”) refers to a communication link from the UE to the base station.

The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different UEs to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and/or global level. New Radio (NR), which may be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the 3GPP. NR is designed to better support mobile broadband internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink, using CP-OFDM and/or single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) (also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink, as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, further improvements in LTE, NR, and other radio access technologies remain useful.

11894241	"BACKGROUND

In wafer-to-wafer bonding technology, various methods have been developed to bond two package components (such as wafers) together. The available bonding methods include fusion bonding, eutectic bonding, direct metal bonding, hybrid bonding, and the like. In the hybrid bonding, the metal pads of two wafers are bonded to each other through direct metal-to-metal bonding, and an oxide surface of one of the two wafers is bonded to an oxide surface or a silicon surface of the other wafer.

The wafer-to-wafer bonding has high requirement for the co-planarity of the bonding surfaces of the wafers. For example, the bonding surfaces of the metal pads need to be coplanar with the bonding surfaces of the dielectric layers, so that both of the direct metal-to-metal bonding and the fusion bonding may be achieved. The co-planarity, however, is difficult to achieve. For example, the top surfaces of the wafers are typically planarized through Chemical Mechanical Polish (CMP) processes. The CMP processes, however, suffer from dishing problems.

12020158	"BACKGROUND

In a wireless network, a base station provides a user equipment (UE) with connectivity to various services, such as data and/or voice services, over a cell coverage area. The base station typically determines configurations for a wireless connection used by the UE to access the services. For example, the base station determines bandwidth and timing configurations of the wireless connection.

The quality of the wireless connection between the base station and the UE often varies based on a number of factors, such as signal strength, bandwidth limitations, interfering signals, and so forth. A first UE operating at an edge of a cell coverage area, for example, typically receives a weaker signal from the base station relative to a second UE operating relatively close to the center of the cell coverage area. Thus, as the UE moves to different regions of the cell coverage area, the quality of service sometimes degrades. With recent advancements in wireless communication systems, such as Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR), new approaches may be available to improve the quality of service.

SUMMARY

This document describes techniques and apparatuses for deep neural network (DNN) processing for a user equipment-coordination set (UECS). In aspects, a network entity selects an end-to-end (E2E) machine-learning (ML) configuration that forms an E2E DNN for processing UECS communications. The network entity directs each device of multiple devices participating in an UECS to form, using at least a portion of the E2E ML configuration, a respective sub-DNN of the E2E DNN that transfers the UECS communications through the E2E communication, where the multiple devices include at least one base station, a coordinating user equipment (UE), and at least one additional UE. The network entity receives feedback associated with the UECS communications and identifies an adjustment to the E2E ML configuration. The network entity then directs at least some of the multiple devices participating in an UECS to update the respective sub-DNN of the E2E DNN based on the adjustment.

In aspects, a coordinating user equipment (UE) confirms, with a network entity, a training schedule that indicates a time period to maintain one or more fixed machine-learning (ML) architectures of a second portion of an end-to-end (E2E) ML configuration that forms a second set of sub-deep neural networks (sub-DNNs), of an E2E DNN, that transfer wireless-network-based user equipment-coordination set (UECS) communications through an E2E communication. The coordinating UE determines, based on the training schedule, an adjustment to the first portion of the E2E ML configuration that forms the first set of sub-DNNs that transfer the local-wireless-network-based UECS communications through the E2E communication. In response to determining the adjustment, the coordinating UE directs one or more additional UEs participating in the UECS to update one or more sub-DNNs of the first set of sub-DNNs using the adjustment to the first portion of the E2E ML configuration.

The details of one or more implementations of DNN processing for a UECS are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the following description. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims. This summary is provided to introduce subject matter that is further described in the Detailed Description and Drawings. Accordingly, this summary should not be considered to describe essential features nor used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

This non-provisional utility application claims priority to UK patent application number 2218511.0 entitled “MEDIA SLICE TRACKING IN A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK” and filed on Dec. 8, 2022, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

BACKGROUND

Communications networks, such as voice over internet protocol (VoIP) networks and other types of packet-based communications network facilitate media services such as video/audio calls and audio/video streaming by enabling the transfer of media such as any one or more of: images, videos, audio signals between computing devices.

Degraded performance or quality is a common issue encountered when providing media services in communications networks. Examples of poor media quality include but are not limited to: pixelated video, loss of video, loss of audio, noisy audio.

The embodiments described below are not limited to implementations which solve any or all of the disadvantages of known ways of tracking media flows in communications networks.

SUMMARY

The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present a selection of concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Tracking media slices through a communications network is useful for identifying causes of media quality problems, such as where video, audio or other services are provided in a VOIP communications network.

11960704	"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The disclosure is related to consumer goods and, more particularly, to methods, systems, products, features, services, and other elements directed to media playback or some aspect thereof.

BACKGROUND

Options for accessing and listening to digital audio in an out-loud setting were limited until in 2003, when SONOS, Inc. filed for one of its first patent applications, entitled “Method for Synchronizing Audio Playback between Multiple Networked Devices,” and began offering a media playback system for sale in 2005. The Sonos Wireless HiFi System enables people to experience music from many sources via one or more networked playback devices. Through a software control application installed on a smartphone, tablet, or computer, one can play what he or she wants in any room that has a networked playback device. Additionally, using the controller, for example, different songs can be streamed to each room with a playback device, rooms can be grouped together for synchronous playback, or the same song can be heard in all rooms synchronously.

Given the ever growing interest in digital media, there continues to be a need to develop consumer-accessible technologies to further enhance the listening experience.

11985446	"BACKGROUND

This disclosure generally relates to providing graphics for video conversations and in particularly to customizing the graphics for particular users of an online system.

Users of an online system may communicate in real-time using video conversations. For example, two users each have a smartphone device that includes a camera, microphone, and speaker that enable the two users to talk to each other and see a video feed of each other. Existing systems that facilitate video conversations may not provide a particularly engaging user experience that is customized based on the participating users. For example, the two users are friends participating in the video conversation from their home or office. After catching up on each other's day, the friends run out of topics to discuss with one another, which may result in awkward silences. Thus, the friends may stop the video conversation or feel unsatisfied with the video conversation and system overall. It is desirable for an online system to provide engaging video conversations in order to encourage users to continue using services of the online system.

SUMMARY

An online system customizes video conversations between users of the online system. Users participate in a video conversation using client devices, and during the video conversation, the online system can present composite views to the participating users via displays of the client devices. A composite view may include visual representations of the users, a background graphic, or other types of graphics such as masks and props that the users can wear or interact with in the environment of the video conversation. The visual representations may be generated based on a live video feed of the users captured by the client devices and/or include avatars of the users (e.g., a “cartoonized” visual representation). Because many different types of graphical content may be used in conjunction with the live video feed, as used herein a “background graphic” represents graphical content that appears behind other content in the live video feed such as a user or a user's avatar in the composite view, while “graphics” represent other graphical content that may appear in the foreground and obscure other features of the video feed, for example as either imposed on top of a background graphic or in front of a user or a user's avatar.

The online system can determine additional graphics to include in the composite views based on information about the users. For instance, based on actions performed by the users on the online system or a third party system, the online system determines a background graphic showing a geographical location that the users have each visited. Upon viewing the background graphic, the users may be encouraged to interact with the background graphic or other graphics included in the composite view, which can promote an engaging video conversation experience. Further, third party systems may provide graphics to the online system that include sponsored content for presentation to users during video conversations.

In one embodiment, a method identifies users of the online system participating in a video conversation, where each user has a client device presenting visual representations of one or more of the users. In response to receiving a selection from one of the users for a background graphic, and for each of the users, the online system provides the background graphic to be included in a composite view presented by the corresponding client device of the user. The composite view overlays the visual representations of the one or more users on the background graphic. The online system determines a first set of graphics for a first user of the users. Each of the graphics is associated with one or more designated portions of the composite view presented by the client device of the first user. The online system provides one or more graphics of the first set to be included in the composite view presented by the client device of the first user. In response to receiving an interaction performed by the first user with a graphic of the one or more graphics, the online system modifies the composite view presented by the client device of the first user. For instance, the online system overlays the graphic on the one or more designated portions of the composite view corresponding to the graphic.

BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE

Field of the Present Disclosure

The present disclosure relates to a driver assistance system for vehicles. More, it relates to a driver assistance system for vehicles, which is capable of preventing driver carelessness from causing a vehicle accident when a vehicle stops while traveling.

Description of Related Art

Occasionally, a vehicle may temporarily stop while traveling. For example, the vehicle temporarily stops at a stop signal of a traffic light or at a toll gate on a highway to pay a toll while traveling.

A driver stops the vehicle by depressing the brake pedal thereof, and the speed of the vehicle reaches “0” (zero).

However, when the driver behaves other than driving after stopping the vehicle, the driver may unintentionally weaken a force depressing the brake pedal (i.e., a pedal effort) or may release the depressed brake pedal together with a decrease in concentration on driving.

When the pedal effort of the brake pedal is reduced or the depressed brake pedal is released with the vehicle stopped, the vehicle may move forward regardless of the intention of the driver (i.e., creep driving).

In the instant case, the driver may accidentally depress an accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal, which may cause a forward collision accident caused by sudden acceleration of the vehicle.

The information included in this Background of the present disclosure is only for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the present disclosure and may not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information forms the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.

The control unit may determine the driver carelessness as a second level when the control unit concludes that the driver does not look ahead, and when a seat hydraulic pressure obtained by the driver seat hydraulic pressure sensor is less than or equal to a predetermined critical hydraulic pressure, or when a pedal depression amount of the brake pedal obtained by the brake pedal sensor is less than or equal to a predetermined critical pedal depression amount.

The control unit may determine the driver carelessness as a third level when the control unit concludes that the driver does not look ahead, and when the seat hydraulic pressure is less than or equal to the critical hydraulic pressure, and when the pedal depression amount of the brake pedal is less than or equal to the critical pedal depression amount.

When the driver carelessness is determined as the first level, the control unit may visually warn of the driver carelessness through a display unit provided in the driver assistance unit.

When the driver carelessness is determined as the second level, the control unit may visually warn of the driver carelessness through the display unit, while audibly warning of the driver carelessness through a warning sound output unit provided in the driver assistance unit.

When the driver carelessness is determined as the third level, the control unit may operate an electric parking brake provided in the driver assistance unit.

When the driver carelessness is determined as the third level, the control unit may shift a gear shifting of a transmission, provided in the driver assistance unit, to a neutral range.

When the driver carelessness is determined as the third level, the control unit may control a vehicle drive motor provided in the driver assistance unit to have a torque of “0”, in which case the vehicle is an electric vehicle using only the vehicle drive motor as a driving power source thereof.

When the driver carelessness is determined as the third level, the control unit may visually and audibly warns of the driver carelessness through a display unit and a warning sound output unit provided in the driver assistance unit.

When a vehicle speed is “0”, a pedal depression amount of a brake pedal of a vehicle is greater than a predetermined critical pedal depression amount, and a gear shifting of a transmission is positioned in a drive range, the control unit may determine that the vehicle stops while traveling.

The control unit may release the operation of the driver assistance unit by determining that the vehicle is in a drivable state when the control unit concludes that a drive seat hydraulic pressure is maintained to be equal to or greater than a predetermined critical hydraulic pressure while the driver assistance unit is in operation, a pedal depression amount of an accelerator pedal is greater than a predetermined critical pedal depression amount, and the driver looks ahead.

12036351	"BACKGROUND

The present disclosure relates generally to medical treatment systems and, more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to dressings, methods, and systems for treating a tissue site on a patient.

Clinical studies and practice have shown that providing reduced pressure in proximity to a tissue site augments and accelerates the growth of new tissue at the tissue site. The applications of this phenomenon are numerous, but application of reduced pressure has been particularly successful in treating wounds. This treatment (frequently referred to in the medical community as “negative pressure wound therapy,” “reduced pressure therapy,” or “vacuum therapy”) provides a number of benefits, which may include faster healing and increased formulation of granulation tissue. It is believed that treatment of low-severity wounds with reduced pressure will yield benefits as well, but issues remain.

SUMMARY

According to an illustrative embodiment, a dressing for treating a tissue site on a patient includes a wound interface member for placing proximate to the tissue site and a covering. At least a portion of the covering comprises an evaporative window having a liquid-impermeable, vapor-permeable membrane. The covering is operable to form a sealed space over the tissue site. The liquid-impermeable, vapor-permeable membrane allows evaporated liquids, e.g., water vapor or a priming fluid, in the sealed space to egress the sealed space. The egress of evaporated liquids may create a reduced pressure in the sealed space.

According to an illustrative embodiment, a method for treating a tissue site with reduced pressure includes placing a wound interface member proximate to the tissue site and covering the wound interface member with a covering having an evaporative window. The evaporative window comprises a liquid-impermeable, vapor-permeable membrane. The covering forms a sealed space over the wound interface member. The method further includes allowing liquids from the tissue site to evaporate and to egress the sealed space through the liquid-impermeable, vapor-permeable membrane. The evaporation may cause a reduced pressure to be created in the sealed space.

According to still another illustrative embodiment, a method of manufacturing a dressing for treating a tissue site includes providing a foam member for placing proximate to the tissue site, providing a covering formed with an evaporative-window opening, and associating a liquid-impermeable, vapor-permeable membrane with the evaporative-window opening to form an evaporative window. The liquid-impermeable, vapor-permeable membrane is operable to allow evaporated liquids to be transmitted through the liquid-impermeable, vapor-permeable membrane.

Other features and advantages of the illustrative embodiments will become apparent with reference to the drawings and detailed description that follow.

BACKGROUND

Cellular immunotherapy is a promising new technology for fighting difficult to treat diseases, such as cancer, and persistent infections and also certain diseases that are refractory to other forms of treatment. A major breakthrough has come across with the discovery of CAR-T cell and their potential use in immunotherapy. CAR-T cells are T lymphocytes expressing a chimeric antigen receptor which helps target the T cell to specific diseased cells such as cancer cells, and can induce cytotoxic responses intended to kill the target cancer cell or immunosuppression and/or tolerance depending on the intracellular domain employed and co-expressed immunosuppressive cytokines. Although CAR T cells continue to remain prospective tools for cancer therapy, several limitations along the way has slowed the progress on CAR-T cells and dampened its promise in clinical trials.

Understanding the limitations of CAR-T cells is the key to leveraging the technology and continue innovations towards better immunotherapy models. Specifically, in T cell malignancies, CAR-T cells appear to have faced a major problem. CAR-T cells and malignant T cells share surface antigen in most T cell lymphomas (TCL), therefore, CAR-T cells are subject to cytotoxicity in the same way as cancer cells. In some instances, the CAR-T products may be contaminated by malignant T cells. Additionally, T cell aplasia is a potential problem due to prolonged persistence of the CAR-T cells. Other limitations include the poor ability for CAR-T cells to penetrate into solid tumors and the potent tumor microenvironment which acts to downregulate their anti-tumor potential. CAR-T cell function is also negatively influenced by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that leads to endogenous T cell inactivation and exhaustion.

Myeloid cells, including macrophages, are cells derived from the myeloid lineage and belong to the innate immune system. They are derived from bone marrow stem cells which egress into the blood and can migrate into tissues. Some of their main functions include phagocytosis, the activation of T cell responses, and clearance of cellular debris and extracellular matrices. They also play an important role in maintaining homeostasis, and initiating and resolving inflammation. Moreover, myeloid cells can differentiate into numerous downstream cells, including macrophages, which can display different responses ranging from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory depending on the type of stimuli they receive from the surrounding microenvironment. Furthermore, tissue macrophages have been shown to play a broad regulatory and activating role on other immune cell types including CD8+ and CD4+ T effector cells, NK cells and T regulatory cells. Macrophages have been shown to be a main immune infiltrate in malignant tumors and have been shown to have a broad immunosuppressive influence on effector immune infiltration and function.

SUMMARY

The diverse functionality of myeloid cells makes them an ideal cell therapy candidate that can be engineered to have numerous therapeutic effects. The present disclosure is related to immunotherapy using myeloid cells (e.g., CD14+ cells) of the immune system, particularly phagocytic cells. A number of therapeutic indications could be contemplated using myeloid cells. For example, myeloid cell immunotherapy could be exceedingly important in treating cancer, autoimmunity, fibrotic diseases and infections. The present disclosure is related to immunotherapy using myeloid cells, including phagocytic cells of the immune system, particularly monocytes. It is an object of the invention disclosed herein to harness one or more of these functions of myeloid cells for therapeutic uses. For example, it is an object of the invention disclosed herein to harness the phagocytic activity of myeloid cells, including engineered myeloid cells, for therapeutic uses. For example, it is an object of the invention disclosed herein to harness the ability of myeloid cells, including engineered myeloid cells, to promote T cell activation. For example, it is an object of the invention disclosed herein to harness the ability of myeloid cells, including engineered myeloid cells, to promote secretion of tumoricidal molecules. For example, it is an object of the invention disclosed herein to harness the ability of myeloid cells, including engineered myeloid cells, to promote recruitment and trafficking of immune cells and molecules. In one aspect the disclosure provides new and useful chimeric constructs that, when expressed in a myeloid cell, the myeloid cell can drive targeted attack and phagocytosis of the molecule, molecular assembly, object or a cell that comprises the target, e.g., a target antigen on its surface. One of the many facets of the present disclosure is to (i) enhance the phagocytic ability of the myeloid cells (e.g., the engineered myeloid cells expressing the new and improved chimeric constructs); help initiate a coordinated and sustained immune response against the target (e.g., target antigen). The present disclosure provides innovative methods and compositions that can successfully transfect or transduce a myeloid cell, or otherwise induce a genetic modification in a myeloid cell, with the purpose of augmenting a functional aspect of a myeloid cell, additionally, without compromising the cell's differentiation capability, maturation potential, and/or its plasticity. The resultant cells may be termed therapeutically effective engineered myeloid cells, or effector myeloid cells. One strategy for improvement described herein is to induce an inflammatory phenotype of the myeloid cells to develop effector myeloid cells. One strategy is to generate effector myeloid cells capable of mounting an inflammatory phenotype upon engagement with the target. In one aspect, the effector myeloid cell is capable of inducing or activating an interferon type I response within the myeloid cells upon engagement to its target. Another strategy is to potentiate the interferon type I response in the myeloid cells to develop these cells into effector myeloid cells. One strategy for inducing an inflammatory phenotype is to induce or activate an NF-kB response in the effector myeloid cell upon engagement to its target. One strategy to develop myeloid cells isolated from a biological sample into effector myeloid cells for immunotherapy described herein is to induce and/or potentiate interferon type I response or NF-kappa B response or both in the myeloid cells.

The present disclosure involves making and using engineered myeloid cells (e.g., CD14+ cells, such as macrophages or other phagocytic cells, which can attack and kill (ATAK) diseased cells directly and/or indirectly, such as cancer cells and infected cells. Engineered myeloid cells, such as macrophages and other phagocytic cells, can be prepared by incorporating nucleic acid sequences (e.g., mRNA, DNA, plasmids, viral constructs) encoding a chimeric fusion protein (CFP), that has an extracellular binding domain specific to disease associated antigens (e.g., cancer antigens), into the cells using, for example, recombinant nucleic acid technology, synthetic nucleic acids, gene editing techniques (e.g., CRISPR), transduction (e.g., using viral constructs), electroporation, or nucleofection. It has been found that myeloid cells can be engineered to have a broad and diverse range of activities. For example, it has been found that myeloid cells can be engineered to express a chimeric fusion protein (CFP) containing an antigen binding domain to have a broad and diverse range of activities. For example, it has been found that myeloid cells can be engineered to have enhanced phagocytic activity such that upon binding of the CFP to an antigen on a target cell, the cell exhibits increased phagocytosis of the target cell. It has also been found that myeloid cells can be engineered to promote T cell activation such that upon binding of the CFP to an antigen on a target cell, the cell promotes activation of T cells, such as T cells in the tumor microenvironment. The engineered myeloid cells can be engineered to promote secretion of tumoricidal molecules such that upon binding of the CFP to an antigen on a target cell, the cell promotes secretion of tumoricidal molecules from nearby cells. The engineered myeloid cells can be engineered to promote recruitment and trafficking of immune cells and molecules such that upon binding of the CFP to an antigen on a target cell, the cell promotes recruitment and trafficking of immune cells and molecules to the target cell or a tumor microenvironment.

The present disclosure is based on the important finding that engineered myeloid cells overcome at least some of the limitations of CAR-T cells, including being readily recruited to solid tumors; having an engineerable duration of survival, therefore lowering the risk of prolonged persistence resulting in aplasia and immunodeficiency; myeloid cells cannot be contaminated with T cells; myeloid cells can avoid fratricide, for example, because they do not express the same antigens as malignant T cells; and myeloid cells have a plethora of anti-tumor functions that can be deployed. In some respects, engineered myeloid derived cells can be safer immunotherapy tools to target and destroy diseased cells.

Moreover, myeloid cells, such as macrophages, have been ubiquitously found in the tumor environment (TME) and are notably the most abundant cells in some tumor types. As part of their role in the immune system, myeloid cells, such as macrophages, are naturally engaged in clearing diseased cells. The present invention relates too harnessing myeloid cell function and specifically for targeting, killing and directly and/or indirectly clearing diseased cells as well as the delivery payloads such as antigens and cytokines.

Engineered myeloid cells can also be short-lived in vivo, phenotypically diverse, sensitive, plastic, and are often found to be difficult to manipulate in vitro. For example, exogenous gene expression in monocytes has been difficult compared to exogenous gene expression in non-hematopoietic cells. There are significant technical difficulties associated with transfecting myeloid cells (e.g., monocytes/macrophages). As professional phagocytes, myeloid cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, comprise many potent degradative enzymes that can disrupt nucleic acid integrity and make gene transfer into these cells an inefficient process. This is especially true of activated macrophages which undergo a dramatic change in their physiology following exposure to immune or inflammatory stimuli. Viral transduction of these cells are not ideal because macrophages are end-stage cells that generally do not divide; therefore, some of the vectors that depend on integration into a replicative genome have met with limited success. Furthermore, macrophages are quite responsive to “danger signals,” and therefore several of the original viral vectors that were used for gene transfer induced potent anti-viral responses in these cells making these vectors inappropriate for gene delivery. Additionally, myeloid cells have potential to differentiate into phenotypic variants that have distinct functionality, and under certain circumstances may be ineffective for the purpose intended for in vivo use. For example, a myeloid cell necessary for active migration to tumor and effective tumoricidal activity may be required to be delivered in vivo in a cellular stage that retains its plasticity, based on identification of certain cell surface markers. Myeloid cell plasticity can be affected by the nature of isolation, handling, mode of introduction of nucleic acid material into the cell ex vivo in order to engineer the cell, and so forth. While myeloid cells of various cellular stages (e.g., myeloid cells at high, or low plasticity stages, or myeloid cells with phenotypes conferring to inflammatory or else immunomodulatory function) are each of particular value for the purpose intended for in vivo use, and that all of which are within the purview of the instant disclosure, at least in one aspect, the methods discussed herein focus on generation of a therapeutic myeloid cell population with the retention of a high degree myeloid cell plasticity prior to in vivo administration. In one aspect, the present disclosure provides innovative methods and compositions that can successfully transfect or transduce a myeloid cell, or otherwise induce a genetic modification in a myeloid cell, with the purpose of augmenting a functional aspect of a myeloid cell, additionally, without compromising the cell's differentiation capability, maturation potential, and/or its plasticity.

The present disclosure is generally related to virtualized computer systems, and more particularly, to improving memory access handling for peripheral component interconnect devices.

BACKGROUND

Virtualization herein shall refer to abstraction of some physical components into logical objects in order to allow running various software modules, for example, multiple operating systems, concurrently and in isolation from other software modules, on one or more interconnected physical computer systems. Virtualization allows, for example, consolidating multiple physical servers into one physical server running multiple virtual machines in order to improve the hardware utilization rate.

Virtualization may be achieved by running a software layer, often referred to as “hypervisor,” above the hardware and below the virtual machines. A hypervisor may run directly on the server hardware without an operating system beneath it or as an application running under a traditional operating system. A hypervisor may abstract the physical layer and present this abstraction to virtual machines to use, by providing interfaces between the underlying hardware and virtual devices of virtual machines.

Processor virtualization may be implemented by the hypervisor scheduling time slots on one or more physical processors for a virtual machine, rather than a virtual machine actually having a dedicated physical processor. Memory virtualization may be implemented by employing a page table (PT) which is a memory structure translating virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. Device and input/output (I/O) virtualization involves managing the routing of I/O requests between virtual devices and the shared physical hardware.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION

Technical Problem

However, in the capacitive pressure sensor having the configuration described above, when a foam sheet was used as the material of the elastic body layer, even when adhesive layers were provided on surfaces of the elastic body layer on the first electrode sheet side and on the second electrode sheet side, an adhesive force of the adhesive layers with respect to the elastic body layer failed to be sufficiently obtained in some cases.

In this case, there may be a case where the electrode sheet partially peels off from the elastic body layer, and electrodes on the electrode sheet on the pressing side do not integrally move along deformation of the elastic body layer, and therefore the pressure sensor cannot accurately detect the pressure.

Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a capacitive pressure sensor that allows sufficiently obtaining an adhesive force of an adhesive layer with respect to an elastic body layer made of foam sheet.

Solution to Problem

Some aspects will be described below as means to solve the problems. These aspects can be combined arbitrarily as necessary.

A capacitive pressure sensor according to the present invention includes a first electrode sheet, a second electrode sheet, an elastic body layer, and adhesive layers. In the first electrode sheet, a first electrode layer is formed on a first insulating sheet. In the second electrode sheet, a second electrode layer is formed on a second insulating sheet. The elastic body layer is formed by a foam sheet in which air bubbles having an average air bubble diameter of 2 to 40 μm are dispersed and sandwiched between the first electrode sheet and the second electrode sheet. One of the adhesive layers is formed on a surface of the elastic body layer on a side of the first electrode sheet and another of the adhesive layers is formed on a surface of the elastic body layer on a side of the second electrode sheet.

The present inventor considered that a low adhesive force of the adhesive layers of the prior art with respect to the elastic body layer was caused by the large number of open air bubbles on the surface of the foam sheet constituting the elastic body layer. In other words, the open air bubbles on the surface of the elastic body layer are inlets where an adhesive of the adhesive layer before curing penetrates the elastic body layer, and the penetration of the adhesive of the adhesive layer into the elastic body layer from the inlets thins the film thickness of the entire adhesive layer by the amount. As a result, the adhesive force of the adhesive layer with respect to the elastic body layer cannot be sufficiently obtained.

Therefore, with the air bubbles of the foam sheet being the fine air bubbles having the average air bubble diameter of 2 to 40 μm, even when the air bubbles open on the surface of the elastic body layer, the film thickness of the entire adhesive layer is not thinned due to the penetration of the adhesive from the open air bubbles into the elastic body layer. Therefore, the adhesive force of the adhesive layer with respect to the elastic body layer is sufficiently obtained.

As a result, in the capacitive pressure sensor of the present invention, the electrode sheet does not partially peel off from the elastic body layer. Consequently, it does not happen that the electrodes on the electrode sheet on the pressing side do not integrally move along the deformation of the elastic body layer, and thus the pressure sensor can accurately detect the pressure.

In addition, a foam structure of the elastic body layer does not change due to the penetration of the adhesive of the adhesive layer into the elastic body layer and the elastic body layer performs the predetermined elastic deformation, and therefore obviously, a pressure sensor1can accurately detect the pressure.

As one aspect, 95% or more of the air bubbles preferably have an air bubble diameter of 50 μm or less.

According to the configuration described above, even when the air bubbles open on the surface of the elastic body layer, since the most air bubbles41among them do not drastically vary to be greater than the upper limit of the average air bubble diameter, the reduction in film thickness of the entire adhesive layer can be further suppressed, and the adhesive force of the adhesive layer with respect to the elastic body layer can be more reliably obtained.

As one aspect, Vg/(Vp+Vg) in a surface layer region at a depth of 20 μm from a surface of the foam sheet is preferably smaller than a half of Vg/(Vp+Vg) in an inner region deeper than the surface layer region of the foam sheet

Vg: volume of gases in the air bubbles contained per unit volume

Vp: volume of plastic contained per unit volume in a portion where the air bubbles are absent.

According to the configuration described above, the elastic body layer has a structure such that the surface of the foam sheet is covered with a film, and thus the penetration of the adhesive into the air bubbles does not occur.

Also, as one aspect, the air bubbles are preferably open cells.

When the air bubbles are closed cells, air in the air bubbles cannot escape when pressing input is performed, possibly resulting in a rupture of the air bubbles. When the air bubbles are ruptured, a present state of the air bubbles in the elastic body layer changes over time. That is, the degree of deformation of the elastic body layer during the pressing input changes, and sensitivity of the pressure sensor does not become constant.

In contrast, when the air bubbles are the open cells, the air in the air bubbles can escape when the pressing input is performed, so the rupture of the air bubbles can be avoided. Therefore, the present state of the air bubbles in the elastic body layer does not change over time, and the sensitivity of the pressure sensor can be maintained constant.

In addition, as one aspect, an adhesive used in the adhesive layer before curing preferably has a viscosity from 10 to 200 PaS.

According to the configuration described above, even when the air bubbles open on the surface of the elastic body layer, since the viscosity before curing is high, penetration of the adhesive from the open air bubbles into the elastic body layer can be suppressed. Therefore, the adhesive force of the adhesive layer with respect to the elastic body layer is sufficiently obtained.

Also, as one aspect, the adhesive is preferably a thermosetting adhesive.

According to the configuration described above, even with the electrode sheet having an opaque portion, the adhesive layer can be uniformly cured. The adhesive is also excellent in screen printability.

In addition, as one aspect, the foam sheet is preferably made of a silicone resin.

According to the configuration described above, restorability of the elastic body layer after the pressing is released is improved. In addition, a degree of deformation is less likely to vary due to, for example, a change in temperature during use of the pressure sensor, and the sensitivity of the pressure sensor can be maintained constant.

As one aspect, the foam sheet preferably has a thickness of 50 μm to 200 μm.

According to the configuration described above, the pressure sensor having sufficient sensitivity can be obtained.

Advantageous Effects of Invention

The pressure sensor of the present invention allows sufficiently obtaining the adhesive force of the adhesive layer with respect to the elastic body layer made of the foam sheet.

On the other hand, letting the base cover1D′ be provided with a plurality of air vents1D1′ thereon is found to be helpful in exhausting heat flow into air by using the radiating fans12′.

It needs to further explain that, an operating temperature of the CPU101′ or the GUP102′ is commonly greater than 70° C. Therefore, in case of a user putting the laptop computer1′ on his thighs and then operating it, the CPU101′ and the GPU102′ working in high operating load would generate high temperature so as to cause the base cover1D′ has a high surface temperature. As a result, it is inevitable that the user's thighs would be scalded by the base cover1D′. In view of that, U.S. Pat. No. 8,526,179 discloses a laptop computer having thermal isolation design. Please refer toFIG.1andFIG.2again. According to the disclosures of U.S. Pat. No. 8,526,179, an thermal isolation plate is disposed on an outer surface of the base cover1D′, so as to form a thermal isolation between the base cover1D′ and the user's thighs. As such, in case of the user putting the laptop computer1′ on his thighs and then operating it, although the CPU101′ and the GPU102′ working in high operating load generate high temperature to cause the base cover1D′ has a high surface temperature, the user's thighs is protected by the thermal isolation plate from being scalded the outer surface of the base cover1D′.

However, it is a pity that, the thermal isolation plate is also forms a thermal isolation between the base cover1D′ and air, thereby not only leading the heat dissipation efficiency of the conventionally-used thermal solution to be largely reduced, but also causing the heat flow blew out by the radiating fans12′ fail to be exhausted via the air vents1D1′ of the base cover1D′.

From above descriptions, it is understood that there is still room for improvement in the conventional thermal solutions. In view of that, inventors of the present application have made great efforts to make inventive research and eventually provided a casing structure with functionality of effective thermal management.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The primary objective of the present invention is to disclose a casing structure with functionality of effective thermal management for being applied in an electronic device by a form of a top casing and/or a back casing. The casing structure comprises a casing member, a low thermal conductivity medium, a second heat spreader, and a first heat spreader. In case of a user operating the electronic device, heat generated from a heat source like CPU or GPU is thermally transferred to the second heat spreader via the first heat spreader, and then is two-dimensionally spread in the second heat spreader. Consequently, the heat is dissipated away from the casing member to air due to the outstanding thermal radiation ability of the casing member. Particularly, the present invention let the low thermal conductivity medium be disposed between the second heat spreader and the casing member, such that the low thermal conductivity medium is able to control heat transfer of heat transferring paths from the heat source to the casing member. Therefore, by applying the casing structure in an electronic device by a form of a top casing and/or a back casing, an outer surface temperature of the casing member can be well controlled because the heat generated by the heat source is continuously dissipated away from the casing member to air.

It is worth explaining that, since the casing member possesses an outstanding thermal radiation ability, the heat transferred to the casing member would be massively radiated to air through the outer surface of the casing member. Briefly speaking, letting the casing structure be applied in an electronic device not only achieves a good thermal management of the heat source (such as CPU and GPU) in the electronic device (like a laptop computer), but also make the outer surface temperature (i.e., skin temperature) of the casing member (e.g., D cover of the laptop computer) be well controlled. Therefore, in case of a user putting the laptop computer that is integrated with the casing structure with functionality of effective thermal management of the present invention on his thighs and then operating it, the user's thighs would not be scalded by the D cover of the laptop computer, or feel any uncomfortable resulted from the high-temperature outer surface of the D cover.

BACKGROUND

Machine learning is the science of inducing computing systems to act without being explicitly programmed. Classical machine learning includes various clustering and classification techniques, including K-means clustering, linear and logistic regressions, stochastic gradient decent, association rule learning, and the like. Deep learning is a newer frontier in machine learning. Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Deep learning algorithms can be unsupervised (e.g., pattern analysis) or supervised (e.g., classification). The deep learning algorithm can be implemented using layers of an artificial neural network (ANN) (referred to herein as a “neural network”).

In general, a neural network is a collection of nodes (i.e., the “neurons”) that are connected in a graph. A node in a neural network computes a sum of weighted inputs and adds an optional bias to the sum. The output of the node is a function of the final sum (referred to as an “activation function”). Example activation functions include the sigmoid function, the hyperbolic tangent (tank) function, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function, and the identity function. Neural network models are often organized into layers of nodes, which define a specific topology, and corresponding weights and biases. The weights and biases are referred to as network parameters.

In general, a neural network includes an input layer and an output layer and can optionally include one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers. A neural network used in deep learning applications typically includes many hidden layers, which gives rise to the term deep neural network (DNN). The layers of a neural network can be densely connected (e.g., each node in a layer is fully connected to all nodes in a previous layer) or sparsely connected (e.g., each node in a layer is connected to only a portion of the nodes in a previous layer). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of DNN that includes one or more sparsely connected layers, referred to as convolutional layers. A CNN is well-suited for processing image or video data. Other types of DNNs include recurrent neural network (RNNs), which are well-suited for processing speech and text data.

A modern field programmable gate array (FPGA) provides millions of look-up tables and thousands of configurable logic blocks (CLB), digital signal processing (DSP) and random access memory blocks (BRAM) that can be utilized to create massively parallel hardware systems. Existing FPGA systems are configured using either a hardware description language (HDL) or program code (e.g., C or C++) which is scheduled using a high level synthesis (HLS) tool.

In the HDL approach, all processes are scheduled manually with very complex state machines and data management logic. However, this process is time consuming for large scale FPGA systems. In a single thread software function, the complexity of scheduling thousands of processes grows exponentially and in some cases the scheduling is unable to converge.

SUMMARY

Techniques for scheduling a neural network are described. One example is a method which includes receiving a model defining a sequential order of a plurality of functions performed when executing at least one layer in the neural network where the neural network comprises a plurality of layers. The method includes receiving a systolic array for executing identical processes in the at least one layer of the neural network and compiling source code corresponding to the model and the systolic array into a hardware level design that provides a static schedule when executing the neural network in a hardware system.

Another example is a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions, which when executed on one or more processing devices, perform an operation for scheduling a neural network. The operation includes receiving a model defining a sequential order of a plurality of functions performed when executing at least one layer in the neural network where the neural network comprises a plurality of layers. The operation includes receiving a systolic array for executing identical processes in the at least one layer of the neural network and compiling source code corresponding to the model and the systolic array into a hardware level design that provides a static schedule when executing the neural network in a hardware system.

12099074	"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to controls for forced air electric heaters and other components in heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and/or refrigeration (HVACR) systems.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Forced air electric heaters in HVACR systems are equipped with thermally activated switches to monitor the temperature of a forced air electric heater's heating element in the forced air electric heater and turn off the heating element when the temperature is above a safe limit. These thermally activated switches have a limited cycle life, so another device can be used to reduce the frequency of cycling of the thermally activated switches.

Because the most common cause of the temperature of a forced air electric heater's heating element rising above a desired temperature limit is insufficient air flow, an air flow sensing device is often connected to the heating element to turn off the forced air electric heater's heating element when air flow is insufficient.

These air flow sensing devices are most often a mechanical switch connected to a hinged sail (sail switch), or enclosed diaphragm arranged to sense air flow velocity, pressure, or differential pressure between a fan inlet and fan outlet. Other solutions mount a temperature sensor close to the forced air electric heater heating's element to sense a high temperature when air flow is not sufficient.

However, these electro-mechanical switch solutions are difficult to adjust and require periodic readjustment. And, the temperature sensing solutions are not as reliable as direct air flow sensing. Therefore, an improved apparatus and method to determine air flow is desired to overcome these current limitations and difficulties.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

For purposes of summarizing the invention, certain aspects, advantages, and novel features of the invention have been described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages may be achieved in accordance with any one particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested herein.

According to various embodiments, the present invention uses a pair of small signal diodes, a first sensing diode and a second sensing diode, to sense air flow as part of an electronic proof of air flow switch (“EPAFS”) and method for same. Both diodes are exposed to the air flow in a HVACR system. The disclosed invention provides a novel and unique apparatus and method to periodically heat a first sensing diode, turn off the heat source to the first sensing diode, and then compare the temperature difference between the heated first sensing diode and the unheated second sensing diode.

In one embodiment, the first sensing diode is heated using pulsating direct current derived from the alternating current (AC) power line as a source of heating pulses. The design is unique in the use of a self-heating sensing element and the use of pulsating direct current derived from the AC voltage as a source of heating pulses. Using the half-rectified AC to pulse heat the first sensing diode eliminates the need to generate the heating pulses by using a microcontroller and other active components therefore getting all the benefits of using less components.

A microcontroller monitors the pulsating direct current, then senses and calculates the temperature difference between the first sensing diode and the second sensing diode when the heating pulse is not present. The temperature difference between the first sensing diode and the second sensing diode represents the sensed air flow. The temperature difference is compared to a reference value set by an adjuster, such as a potentiometer or a jumper. If the air flow is greater than the reference value, a Triac or other suitable switch is turned on to enable the forced air electric heater control circuitry.

In another embodiment, the microcontroller functions are replaced by analog electronic circuitry. An analog sample hold circuit monitors the pulsating direct current, then samples the temperature difference between the first sensing diode and the second sensing diode when the heating pulse is not present and holds the temperature difference between the first sensing diode and the second sensing diode when the heating pulse is present. An analog comparator compares the temperature difference to a reference value set by an adjuster, such as a potentiometer. If the air flow is greater than the reference value, a Triac or other suitable switch is turned on to enable the forced air electric heater control circuitry.

In another embodiment, the second sensing diode, which is not heated, is also used to sense the air flow temperature. A circuit is added to amplify the signal from the second sensing diode. The amplified signal is connected to the microcontroller as a temperature indication. As an additional safety measure, the switch is turned off when the temperature of the second sensing diode is too high for safe operation of the heater.

In another embodiment, the microcontroller or analog circuitry outputs the difference of the junction voltage of the diodes to indicate air flow velocity, then outputs the signal as an analog signal indicating air flow velocity.

In another embodiment, multiple pairs of sensing diodes are used. For example, a three-point sensing probe has three unheated diodes wired in series and three heated diodes wired in series. The diode pairs may be placed at different points in the air flow to sense the average air flow.

In another embodiment, an electrical jumper is used to adjust the EPAFS. In this configuration, the jumper is put in place and the forced air electric heater is set to the minimum safe air flow. The jumper is removed, causing the microcontroller in the EPAFS to store the sensed air flow as the minimum air flow allowed to enable the heater's heating element.

In another embodiment, the EPAFS is used to monitor air flow through an air conditioner or refrigeration evaporator. Refrigeration evaporators may be used in applications where ice accumulates on the air side of the evaporator. Accumulated ice blocks air flow, preventing proper operation of the evaporator. Equipment with evaporators, such as refrigeration systems, where frost can occur are often fitted with a mechanism to defrost the evaporator. The defrost cycle is often initiated by a timer, regardless of frost build up, resulting in energy waste. A better solution is to sense air flow using EPAFS and a diode probe such as single point remote air flow sensor or a multi-point remote air flow sensor. The EPAFS may be installed in the evaporator air flow to sense low air flow, indicating an ice buildup. When low evaporator air flow is detected, the EPAFS signals the air conditioning or refrigeration equipment to start a defrost cycle.

In a further embodiment, the EPAFS is mounted to the inlet cone of a fan to determine whether there is sufficient air flow through the fan.

Accordingly, one or more embodiments of the present invention overcomes one or more of the shortcomings of the known prior art.

The present invention relates to a sliding component used in a rotating machine including an eccentric mechanism.

BACKGROUND ART

In the related art, a scroll compressor used in an automotive air conditioning system as an example of a rotating machine including an eccentric mechanism is provided with a scroll compression mechanism including a fixed scroll provided with a spiral lap on the surface of an end plate and a movable scroll provided with a spiral lap on the surface of an end plate, an eccentric mechanism eccentrically rotating a rotary shaft, and so on.

CITATION LIST

Patent Literature

Patent Citation 1: JP 2016-61208 A (Pages 5 to 6, FIG. 1)

SUMMARY OF INVENTION

Technical Problem

In the scroll compressor illustrated in Patent Citation 1, a seal ring is interposed between the thrust plate and a housing. As a result, the thrust plate can be axially moved while the back pressure is prevented from leaking out of the back pressure chamber. As a result, the movable scroll can be pressed toward the fixed scroll via the thrust plate. However, the sliding surface of the thrust plate is pressed against the back surface of the movable scroll, and thus the frictional resistance of the sliding surface is large and the operation of the movable scroll may be affected.

The present invention has been made in view of such a problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide a sliding component capable of reducing the frictional resistance of a sliding surface entailing eccentric rotation.

Solution to Problem

In order to solve the above problem, in a sliding component according to the present invention a sliding component formed in an annular shape and having a sliding surface relatively sliding with eccentric rotation, wherein the sliding surface is provided with a plurality of grooves each of which is open to a fluid space on at least one of an inner diameter side and an outer diameter side of the sliding component and which are arranged in a circumferential direction, and a side wall surface of each of the grooves is configured by a wall surface continuous in a circular arc shape in a plan view. According to the aforesaid feature of the present invention, a fluid is capable of flowing in between sliding surfaces from the opening of the groove provided in the sliding surface relatively sliding with the eccentric rotation, dynamic pressure can be generated along the side wall surface constituting the groove in accordance with the direction of the relative movement of the groove entailed by the eccentric rotation, and the sliding component moves with the dynamic pressure generated in a different aspect in each groove. Accordingly, the lubricity between the sliding surfaces can be improved and the frictional resistance of the sliding surface can be reduced by the sliding surfaces being slightly separated from each other while the vibration, inclination, or the like of the sliding component attributable to dynamic pressure is suppressed and a fluid film being formed. Accordingly, dynamic pressure can be generated at all times in the groove positioned in the range continuous in the circumferential direction of the sliding surface.

It may be preferable that each of the grooves is formed in a semicircular shape having a center at an innermost or outermost diameter of the sliding surface in the plan view. According to this preferable configuration, a stable dynamic pressure can be generated in any direction of relative movement corresponding to the substantially semicircular arc-shaped wall surface of the groove. Accordingly, dynamic pressure can be generated at all times in the groove positioned in the range of approximately 180 degrees in the circumferential direction of the sliding surface.

It may be preferable that each of the grooves is open to the fluid space on the inner diameter side. According to this preferable configuration, the fluid flowing into the groove from the opening of the groove is easily held in the groove by the centrifugal force.

It may be preferable that each of the grooves is open to the fluid space on a high-pressure side. According to this preferable configuration, a fluid easily flows into the groove from the opening of the groove using the pressure of the fluid, and thus a higher dynamic pressure can be generated.

It may be preferable that the sliding component is be one of a pair of relatively sliding components having a radial width smaller than a radial width of remaining one of the relatively sliding components. According to this preferable configuration, dynamic pressure can be reliably generated by the groove between the sliding surfaces sliding relative to each other with eccentric rotation.

BACKGROUND

Human emotions are often manifested in facial expressions. The human face contains over forty muscles acting in coordination to produce myriad facial expressions. The facial expressions can represent cognitive states such as anger, fear, sadness, disgust, contempt, surprise, and happiness. Facial muscles form the facial expressions by brow raising, smiling, nose wrinkling, and other actions that are indicative of emotions or reactions to an external stimulus. A person might wrinkle her nose in response to an unpleasant smell, smile in response to something she finds funny, and lower her brow in response to something invoking confusion or skepticism. Human emotions frequently result from external stimuli. On any given day, an individual encounters a wide variety of external stimuli including any combination of visual, aural, tactile, and other types of stimuli. Alone or in combination, the stimuli can invoke strong cognitive states in the individual. An individual's reactions to the received stimuli provide insight into the thoughts and feelings of the individual. Furthermore, the individual's responses to the stimuli can have a profound impact on the cognitive states experienced by the individual. The cognitive states of an individual can vary widely, ranging from happiness to sadness, contentment to worry, and tranquility to excitement, to name only a very few possible states.

People experience various cognitive states while they travel. Some people travel from one location to another for financial reasons such as commuting to and from work or school; for personal reasons such as pleasure, relaxation, or discovery; or for exercise; to name only a few. Other people who travel may be unwilling travelers, fleeing from war, famine, natural disasters, or economic displacement. The modes of transportation include ground transportation, water transportation, and air transportation. People choose a mode of transportation based on convenience, availability, cost, or the purpose of the travel.

People spend a tremendous amount of time traveling. Whether waiting for a vehicle, traveling in a vehicle, attempting to park a vehicle, waiting in security lines to get on a vehicle, among many other travel related activities, substantial portions of time are committed to vehicular travel. Traveling in a vehicle is time consuming at best, and at worst, boring, frustrating, and irritating. Travel time can be time lost from productive activities such as work, study, art, and so on. Rush hour traffic, accidents, and poorly maintained roads complicate vehicle transportation. The difficulties of transportation can be exacerbated by operating an unfamiliar vehicle, traveling in an unfamiliar city, and even in some situations having to remember to drive on the opposite side of the road. Failure to address these transportation realities can have catastrophic consequences. Irritated operators of vehicles can experience road rage and other antisocial behaviors, while bored, sleepy, impaired, distracted, or inattentive drivers can cause vehicular accidents resulting in injury to themselves or other vehicle occupants, pedestrians, bicyclists, and/or animals, and damage to property.

SUMMARY

Vehicular manipulation uses occupant image analysis. The vehicle to be manipulated can be an autonomous vehicle, a semi-autonomous vehicle, and so on. An in-vehicle camera is used to collect cognitive state data from an occupant of the vehicle. The occupant can be the operator of the vehicle or a passenger in the vehicle. The cognitive state data can include image data, facial data, etc. Other in-vehicle sensors can include a microphone for collecting voice data or audio data, and other sensors to collect physiological data. The cognitive state data is collected from the operator or passenger of a vehicle. The vehicle can be a first vehicle, a second vehicle, a public transportation vehicle, etc. The image data and facial image data can be captured using one or more cameras or another image capture apparatus. One or more cognitive state profiles are learned for the occupant of the vehicle. The one or more cognitive state profiles are based on the cognitive state data that was obtained. The cognitive state profile can include cognitive states, mental states, emotional states, moods, preferences of the occupant, and so on. Further cognitive state data is captured from the occupant. The further cognitive state data can be collected while the occupant is in a second vehicle. The second vehicle can be the same vehicle, a second vehicle, a vehicle from a fleet of vehicles, and so on. The further cognitive state data is compared with the cognitive state profile that was generated for the occupant. The comparing of the further cognitive state data can include identifying the occupant of the second vehicle, determining any differences in cognitive state data collected within different vehicles, and so on. The second vehicle is manipulated based on the comparing of the further cognitive state data. The manipulation of the second vehicle can be the same as the manipulation of a first vehicle, can be adapted to a specific make or class of the second vehicle, can be tailored to the second vehicle based on tires or other equipment, can be modified based on weather patterns or traffic patterns, and so on.

Disclosed embodiments provide for vehicle manipulation using convolutional image processing. The convolutional image processing uses a multilayered analysis engine. A plurality of images is obtained using an imaging device within a first vehicle. A multilayered analysis engine is trained using the plurality of images. The multilayered analysis engine includes multiple layers that include convolutional layers and hidden layers. The evaluating provides a cognitive state analysis. Further images are evaluated using the multilayered analysis engine. The further images include facial image data from one or more persons present in a second vehicle. Manipulation data is provided to the second vehicle based on the evaluating the further images. An additional plurality of images of one or more occupants of one or more additional vehicles is obtained. The additional images provide opted-in, crowdsourced image training. The crowdsourced image training enables retraining the multilayered analysis engine. The multilayered analysis engine includes a deep learning network using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The multilayered analysis engine is used for cognitive state analysis. The multilayered analysis engine is used to analyze the plurality of images in a supervised or unsupervised learning process. Further images are evaluated using the multilayered analysis engine, where the further images include facial image data from one or more persons present in a second vehicle. The second vehicle can be an autonomous vehicle or a semi-autonomous vehicle.

A computer-implemented method for vehicle manipulation is disclosed comprising: initializing a computer for convolutional processing; obtaining, using an imaging device within a first vehicle, a plurality of images of an occupant of the first vehicle; training, on the computer initialized for convolutional processing, a multilayered analysis engine using the plurality of images, wherein the multilayered analysis engine includes multiple layers that include one or more convolutional layers and one or more hidden layers, and wherein the multilayered analysis engine is used for cognitive state analysis; evaluating further images, using the multilayered analysis engine, wherein the further images include facial image data from one or more persons present in a second vehicle; and providing manipulation data to the second vehicle based on the evaluating. An additional plurality of images of one or more occupants of one or more additional vehicles can be obtained. The training can include the additional plurality of images. The obtaining an additional plurality of images can be accomplished using opted-in imaging from the one or more occupants of one or more additional vehicles. The opted-in imaging can comprise crowdsourced image training. The crowdsourced image training can comprise retraining the multilayered analysis engine. The crowdsourced image training can be accomplished demographically. The evaluating further images can be weighted by a demographic assessment of the one or more persons present in the second vehicle. The demographic assessment can be provided by at least one of the one or more persons present in the second vehicle. The demographic assessment can be included in the evaluating. Cognitive states can be inferred based on emotional content within a face detected within the facial image data. A cognitive state can be identified using a hidden layer from the one or more hidden layers. The multilayered analysis engine can include a max pooling layer. Weights can be updated during a backpropagation process through the multilayered analysis engine or using a feed-forward process through the multilayered analysis engine. The training of the multilayered analysis engine can comprise deep learning.

11951105	"BACKGROUND

Brexpiprazole, also called REXULTI®, is an atypical antipsychotic used for treating major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. The mechanism of action of brexpiprazole in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia is unknown. However, the efficacy of brexpiprazole may result from partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT1Aand dopamine D2receptors and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT2Areceptors.

The brexpiprazole (REXULTI®) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label revised in March 2020 reflects the state-of-the art regarding the appropriate dosing for patients in need of brexpiprazole, and provides instructions for a brexpiprazole starting dose, recommended dose, and maximum dose with a titration timeline based on a patient's clinical response and tolerability. The FDA label also provides instructions to administer half of the usual dose to patients that are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.

An ideal dosage regimen for brexpiprazole enables psychiatric patients to reach therapeutic levels of brexpiprazole as quickly as possible while avoiding side effects from brexpiprazole. One serious side effect of administering too much brexpiprazole is akathisia, a movement and mental distress disorder which is a state of agitation, distress, and restlessness. Akathisia rates in brexpiprazole patients have been shown to be dose-dependent, and increase as exposure to brexpiprazole increases.

It is not presently recognized in the art that the dosing regimen for brexpiprazole should be adjusted based on the body weight or obesity status of the patient, despite the fact that obesity and schizophrenia or depression are often comorbid conditions. While the REXULTI® label, for example, teaches that weight gain can be a side effect of treatment with brexpiprazole, or that being overweight is a risk factor for other side effects such as hyperglycemia, the label does not instruct any changes in dosing for obese or overweight patients compared to normal weight patients. Brexpiprazole dosing adjustments are only recommended based on the indication treated, hepatic or renal impairment status, drug interactions with CYP2D6 inhibitors, or CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The inventors have discovered that the pharmacokinetics of brexpiprazole are substantively different in obese patients, requiring dosing changes when initiating treatment with brexpiprazole to achieve the same clinical response: effective treatment of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. Prior to this invention, the standard of care left such obese patients untreated or undertreated, delaying resolution of their condition.

The invention addresses additional complexities and identifies modified dosing regimens that are critical to safely and effectively initiate treatment with brexpiprazole. In various embodiments the present invention is directed, inter alia, to specific dose adjustments that avoid under-treatment but do not exceed known exposure levels which would expose patients to serious side effects. In various embodiments the present invention is directed, inter alia, to specific dosing regimens needed for different indications and for different CYP2D6 metabolizer status.

Expected Drug Profile

The expected blood plasma brexpiprazole concentrations during the initiation of brexpiprazole treatment (days 1-28) for patients with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD) according to the brexpiprazole FDA label (revised in March 2020) are shown inFIG.1AandFIG.1B, respectively. Because there was no recognition in the art that the dosing regimen for initiating treatment with brexpiprazole should be adjusted based on the obesity status of the patient, obesity status was not expected to affect the blood plasma concentration of brexpiprazole. In other words, obese patients with schizophrenia or major depressive disorder were expected to have qualitatively similar blood plasma concentrations as normal weight patients.

The present inventors are not aware of anything in the art which would contradict the use of the same brexpiprazole dosing regimen for obese and normal-weight patients disclosed in the FDA-approved label for brexpiprazole. It is acknowledged in the art that body size and obesity can have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of some drugs; however, the clinical relevance of this effect is highly dependent on the particular characteristics of that drug. For example, Hanley et al., in reviewing the effects of obesity on drug pharmacokinetics, found that appropriate drug dosing should be individualized to the particular drug at issue, and that the distribution of a drug in obese patients cannot be entirely predicted based on the physiochemical attributes of the drug (e.g., lipophilicity, hydrophilicity) alone. (Hanley et al., Effect of Obesity on the Pharmacokinetics of Drugs in Humans, Clin. Pharmacokinet 2010, 49(2): 70-87.) The pharmacokinetic studies leading to the approval of brexpiprazole did not include patients with BMI>35 kg/m2, and previous studies have found that the effect of weight on the pharmacokinetics of brexpiprazole was less than 20% and was not a significant determinant in brexpiprazole pharmacokinetics. The inventors are not aware of any evidence in the prior art that suggests that there is any clinically important effect of obesity on brexpiprazole pharmacokinetics that would require any difference in the brexpiprazole dosing regimen between obese and normal-weight patients. Thus, at the time of the present application, the FDA-approved dosing instructions for obese and normal weight patients are the same. However, the present invention is based on the discovery that a patient's body size significantly affects the time it takes a patient to reach therapeutic levels of brexpiprazole. SeeFIG.2AandFIG.2B.

Without this new information, it was not appreciated in the art that, using the instructions for brexpiprazole dosing found in the existing FDA-approved labels for brexpiprazole (at the time of the present disclosure), obese patients do not reach therapeutic levels of brexpiprazole as quickly as normal weight patients upon initiating brexpiprazole treatment; or alternatively stated, it has been discovered that it takes significantly longer to reach therapeutic levels of brexpiprazole in obese patients compared to normal-weight patients using the FDA-approved label's instructions.

The REXULTI® label teaches reducing the dose of brexpiprazole to half of the usual dosage if the patient is a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (CYP2D6 PMs or simply “PMs”). Similarly, the present inventors have also found that the time required to reach therapeutic levels of brexpiprazole for obese patients who are also PMs, using the FDA-approved brexpiprazole dosing regimen (i.e., half of the recommended dose), is longer than for normal-weight PMs.

Thus, prior to the present invention, for obese patient populations (as described herein), the patient's psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and major depressive disorder) were unknowingly left undertreated because these patients did not reach therapeutic concentrations in a similar time as normal-weight patient. Such unintended undertreatment of psychiatric disorders is potentially quite serious, as complications of untreated psychiatric disorders include suicide attempts, anxiety, depression, alcohol or drug abuse, inability to work or attend school, financial problems, homelessness, social isolation, health and medical problems, being victimized, and aggressive behavior.

Thus, the development of the presently disclosed new dosage regimens allow obese patients to reach therapeutic levels of brexpiprazole as quickly as normal-weight patients without putting them at risk of akathisia.

The present disclosure provides an alternative dosing regimen for treating a patient with a psychiatric disorder, such as schizophrenia or major depressive disorder, with brexpiprazole, wherein the patient has one or more of the following characteristics: (i) a BMI of at least about 35; (ii) % IBW of at least about 150%; (iii) waist size greater than about 42 inches; (iv) % body fat greater than about 40%; (v) % android body fat greater than about 40%; (vi) % gynoid body fat greater than about 40%; (vii) total body fat greater than about 40 kg; or (viii) CYP2D6 poor metabolizer.

The present inventors have discovered that patients dosed according to the brexpiprazole FDA label dosage instructions that have any of the aforementioned characteristics do not reach therapeutic levels of brexpiprazole as quickly as non-obese CYP2D6 EM patients. In particular, patients that are obese (e.g., have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) a BMI of at least about 35 kg/m2; (ii) % IBW of at least about 150%; (iii) waist size greater than about 42 inches; (iv) % body fat greater than about 40%; (v) % android body fat greater than about 40%; (vi) % gynoid body fat greater than about 40%; (vii) total body fat greater than about 40 kg) or obese (as defined herein) CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) take longer to reach the similar therapeutic concentrations of patients that are normal-weight CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EM) (FIG.2AandFIG.2B). The brexpiprazole dosage regimen recommended by the FDA label is shown in Table 1.

TABLE 1Brexpiprazole Dosing According to FDA LabelIndicationStarting DoseRecommended DoseMaximum DoseMajor depressive0.5-1mg/day2mg/day3 mg/daydisorder (MDD)Schizophrenia1mg/day2-4mg/day4 mg/day

For adjunctive treatment for MDD, the FDA label recommends a starting dose of brexpiprazole of 0.5 mg, then titrating the starting dose of brexpiprazole up to 1 mg (if starting at 0.5 mg) once daily, and then up to the recommended dosage of 2 mg once daily. Alternatively, the FDA label recommends using a starting dose of 1 mg once daily, then titrating up to the recommended dosage of 2 mg once daily. Dosage increases should occur at weekly intervals based on the patient's clinical response and tolerability. The maximum daily dosage is 3 mg.

For treatment of schizophrenia, the label teaches starting with an initial or starting dose of 1 mg of brexpiprazole administered once daily on each of the first 4 days of treatment (days 1-4), then administering 2 mg once daily on the next 3 days of treatment (day 5 through day 7), and then administering 4 mg once daily on day 8 based on the patient's clinical response and tolerability. The maximum daily dosage is 4 mg.

The dosage for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (patients classified as having a CYP2D6 enzyme phenotype with little or no CYP2D6 activity compared to normal levels of CYP2D6 activity) is half of the dose that would otherwise be administered if the patent was not a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer.

Applicants have developed a modified brexpiprazole dosage regimen for initiating treatment with brexpiprazole that allows obese patients and/or obese CYP2D6 PM (poor metabolizer) patients to reach therapeutically effective concentrations at a similar time compared to normal-weight CYP2D6 EM patients (extensive metabolizers; i.e., patients classified as having a CYP2D6 enzyme phenotype with normal levels of CYP2D6 activity) (FIGS.3-9). As Table D of Example 2 reveals, one embodiment of the modified dosage regimen of the present invention provides double the total daily dose of brexpiprazole of the FDA label on days 1-7. As Table J in Example 3 reveals, other embodiments of the modified dosage regimen provide double the total daily dose of brexpiprazole of the FDA label on days 1-14 or days 1-21.

The FDA label for brexpiprazole (REXULTI® revised March 2020) neither recognizes that obese CYP2D6 EM patients and/or obese CYP2D6 PM patients do not reach therapeutic levels as quickly as normal-weight CYP2D6 EM patients, nor does it provide a dosage regimen that corrects this (hitherto unknown) problem. Instead, the label implicitly teaches that obese CYP2D6 EM should receive the same dose as normal-weight CYP2D6 EM, and explicitly teaches that all CYP2D6 PM patients (i.e., normal-weight and obese) should receive half of the dose that CYP2D6 EM patients receive. However, Applicants have discovered that administering the same dose to obese CYP2D6 EM that normal-weight CYP2D6 EM receive, and half of the dose to obese CYP2D6 PM (as taught by the FDA label) causes obese CYP2D6 EM and obese CYP2D6 PM patients to reach therapeutic brexpiprazole concentrations more slowly than normal-weight CYP2D6 EM patients. Administering brexpiprazole according to a modified dosage regimen provided herein enables obese and/or obese CYP2D6 PM patients to approach therapeutic levels of brexpiprazole as quickly as normal-weight CYP2D6 EM patients (FIGS.3-9).

In embodiments, the disclosure provides method of initiating treatment of schizophrenia with brexpiprazole in an obese patient who is not a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer, comprising: (a) administering 1 mg brexpiprazole twice daily on each of the first 4 days of brexpiprazole treatment; (b) administering 2 mg brexpiprazole twice daily on each of the next 3 days following step (a); and then (c) administering a recommended dose of brexpiprazole once daily thereafter; wherein the obese patient has one or more of the following characteristics: (i) BMI of at least about 35; (ii) % IBW of at least about 150%; (iii) waist size greater than about 42 inches; (iv) % body fat greater than about 40%; (v) % android body fat greater than about 40%; (vi) % gynoid body fat greater than about 40%; or (vii) total body fat greater than about 40 kg.

BACKGROUND

Surgical systems often incorporate an imaging system, which can allow the clinician(s) to view the surgical site and/or one or more portions thereof on one or more displays such as a monitor, for example. The display(s) can be local and/or remote to a surgical theater. An imaging system can include a scope with a camera that views the surgical site and transmits the view to a display that is viewable by a clinician. Scopes include, but are not limited to, arthroscopes, angioscopes, bronchoscopes, choledochoscopes, colonoscopes, cytoscopes, duodenoscopes, enteroscopes, esophagogastro-duodenoscopes (gastroscopes), endoscopes, laryngoscopes, nasopharyngo-neproscopes, sigmoidoscopes, thoracoscopes, ureteroscopes, and exoscopes. Imaging systems can be limited by the information that they are able to recognize and/or convey to the clinician(s). For example, certain concealed structures, physical contours, and/or dimensions within a three-dimensional space may be unrecognizable intraoperatively by certain imaging systems. Additionally, certain imaging systems may be incapable of communicating and/or conveying certain information to the clinician(s) intraoperatively.

SUMMARY

A surgical visualization system may be field programmable. The surgical visualization system may include a field programable gate array (FPGA) and a processor. The FPGA may be configured to transform sensor information of backscattered laser light into real-time information of particle movement (e.g., blood cells) in a portion of a surgical field. The processor may be configured to receive an input and, based on that input, to reconfigure the logic elements of the FPGA, changing the operation of the FPGA from a first transform to a second transform. For example, the logic elements of the FPGA may be configured to assess particle movement at a selectable depth and then reconfigured, at the request of a surgeon, to assess aggregate particle movement over multiple depths.

12054884	"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to textiles and, more specifically, to materials and fabrics and their manufacture, in which the materials and fabrics will have enhanced response characteristics for laser finishing, especially for denim and denim apparel including jeans, shirts, shorts, jackets, vests, and skirts, to obtain a faded, distressed, washed, or worn finish or appearance.

In 1853, during the California Gold Rush, Levi Strauss, a 24-year-old German immigrant, left New York for San Francisco with a small supply of dry goods with the intention of opening a branch of his brother's New York dry goods business. Shortly after arriving in San Francisco, Mr. Strauss realized that the miners and prospectors (called the “forty niners”) needed pants strong enough to last through the hard work conditions they endured. So, Mr. Strauss developed the now familiar jeans which he sold to the miners. The company he founded, Levi Strauss & Co., still sells jeans and is the most widely known jeans brand in the world. Levi's is a trademark of Levi Strauss & Co.

Though jeans at the time of the Gold Rush were used as work clothes, jeans have evolved to be fashionably worn everyday by men and women, showing up on billboards, television commercials, and fashion runways. Fashion is one of the largest consumer industries in the U.S. and around the world. Jeans and related apparel are a significant segment of the industry.

As fashion, people are concerned with the appearance of their jeans. Many people desire a faded or worn blue jeans look. In the past, jeans became faded or distressed through normal wash and wear. The apparel industry recognized people's desire for the worn blue jeans look and began producing jeans and apparel with different wear patterns. The wear patterns have become part of the jeans style and fashion. Some examples of wear patterns include combs or honeycombs, whiskers, stacks, and train tracks.

Despite the widespread success jeans have enjoyed, the process to produce modern jeans with wear patterns takes processing time, has relatively high processing cost, and is resource intensive. A typical process to produce jeans uses significant amounts of water, chemicals (e.g., bleaching or oxidizing agents), ozone, enzymes, and pumice stone. For example, it may take from about 20 to 60 liters of water to finish each pair of jeans.

Therefore, there is a need for an improved materials and fabrics for laser finishing of jeans and other apparel that reduces environmental impact, processing time, and processing costs, while maintaining the look and style of traditional finishing techniques.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A fabric has enhanced response characteristics for laser finishing. The fabric can be denim for denim apparel such as jeans. Software and lasers are used to finish apparel made of the fabric to produce a desired wear or distressing pattern or other design. The fabric allows for relatively fast color change in response to the laser, color changes in hue from indigo blue to white, many grayscale levels, and maintains strength and stretch properties. A method used to make the fabric includes spinning, dyeing, and weaving yarns in such a way to obtain the desired enhanced response characteristics for laser finishing.

In an implementation, a method includes: processing a cotton yarn using an indigo dye to have a cross section having an outer ring and an inner core, where a thickness of the outer ring is about, for example, 10 percent (e.g., from about 7.5 percent to about 12.5 percent) of a total thickness of the yarn, and the outer ring is indigo colored due to being penetrated through by the indigo dye while the inner core is white or off-white colored due to not being penetrated to by the indigo dye; and weaving the dyed cotton yarn into a denim fabric, where the warp yarns include dyed cotton and the weft yarns include undyed cotton, and the denim fabric is to be finished by exposing the dyed cotton yarn to a laser.

When exposed to the laser, the laser creates a finishing pattern on a surface of the garment based on a laser input file provided to the laser. The laser input file includes a laser exposure values for different laser pixel location. For each laser exposure value, the laser removes a depth or thickness of material from the surface of the denim material that corresponds to the laser exposure value.

For lighter pixel locations of the finishing pattern, a greater depth of the indigo ring-dyed cotton yarn is removed, revealing a greater width of an inner core of the dyed yarn, as compared to darker pixel locations of the finishing pattern, where a lesser depth of the indigo ring-dyed cotton yarn is removed, revealing a lesser width of an inner core of the dyed yarn.

In another implementation, a method includes: A garment made from fabric panels of a denim material is provided. The fabric panels are sewn together using thread. The denim material will be finished by using a laser to remove selected amounts of material from a surface of the denim material at selected locations of the garment.

The denim material includes an indigo ring-dyed cotton yarn having cross section having an outer ring and an inner core. A cross-sectional profile of the outer ring relative to the inner core is compatible with the laser to obtain at least 64 different grayscale levels. For the cross-sectional profile, a thickness of the outer ring that is, for example, about 10 percent (e.g., from about 7.5 percent to about 12.5 percent) of a total thickness of the yarn.

The outer ring is indigo colored due to being penetrated through by an indigo dye while the inner core is white or off-white colored due to not being penetrated to by the indigo dye. The indigo ring-dyed cotton yarn with laser-compatible cross-sectional profile is obtained by a dyeing process.

The process can include: mercerizing an undyed yarn in an alkaline solution to obtain an mercerized undyed yarn; immersing the mercerized undyed yarn into at least one indigo dye solution having a pH in a range, for example, from about 10.7 to about 11.6; and exposing the garment to a laser to create a finishing pattern on a surface of the garment based on a laser input file provided to the laser. The laser input file has laser exposure values, each for a different laser pixel location.

For each laser exposure value, the laser will remove a depth of material from the surface of the garment that corresponds to the laser exposure value. Tor lighter pixel locations of the finishing pattern, a greater depth of the indigo ring-dyed cotton yarn is removed as compared to darker pixel locations of the finishing pattern, where a lesser depth of the indigo ring-dyed cotton yarn is removed.
