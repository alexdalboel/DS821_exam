      "Generally, all terms used herein are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning in the relevant technical field, unless a different meaning is clearly given and/or is implied from the context in which it is used. All references to a/an/the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc. are to be interpreted openly as referring to at least one instance of the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc., unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Likewise, any advantage of any of the embodiments may apply to any other embodiments, and vice versa. Other objectives, features, and advantages of the enclosed embodiments will be apparent from the following description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) includes specifications for the Evolved Packet System (EPS). EPS is based on the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) radio network and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). It was originally intended to provide voice and mobile broadband (MBB) services but has continuously evolved to broaden its functionality. 3GPP LTE also includes narrowband Internet-of-things (NB-IoT) and LTE for machine type communication (LTE-M) and provides connectivity to massive machine type communications (mMTC) services.\n",
      "\n",
      "3GPP Release 15 includes the first release of fifth generation (5G) networks. 5G is the next generation radio access technology which provides services such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) and mMTC. 5G can be based on the New Radio (NR) access stratum interface and the 5G Core Network (5GC). NR Release 15 supports operation in a set of new frequency bands in the range 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz. The NR physical and higher layers reuse parts of the LTE specification and add needed components when motivated by the new services.\n",
      "\n",
      "3GPP Release 15 also includes preparation for NR operation in a non-terrestrial network (NTN) (3GPP TR 38.811). Release 16 includes additional NTN features. In parallel, LTE may also be adapted to operate in NTN. For example, LTE-M and NB-IoT may operate in an NTN.\n",
      "\n",
      "A satellite radio access network usually includes a satellite (i.e., a space-borne platform), an earth-based gateway that connects the satellite to a base station or a core network, depending on the choice of architecture, a feeder link (i.e., the link between a gateway and a satellite), and a service link (i.e., the link between a satellite and a user equipment (UE)).\n",
      "\n",
      "Two popular architectures are the bent pipe transponder and the regenerative transponder architectures. In the first case the base station is located on earth behind the gateway, and the satellite operates as a repeater forwarding the feeder link signal to the service link, and vice versa. In the second case the satellite is in the base station and the service link connects it to the earth-based core network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the orbit altitude, a satellite may be categorized as low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), or geostationary (GEO) satellite. LEO typically includes heights ranging from 250-1,500 km and orbital periods ranging from 90-120 minutes. MEO typically includes heights ranging from 5,000-25,000 km and orbital periods ranging from 3-15 hours. GEO typically includes a height at about 35,786 km and an orbital period of 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Propagation delay is one of the main physical properties in a satellite communication system that makes the design different from that of a terrestrial mobile system. For a bent pipe satellite network, the round-trip time (RTT) may, based on the orbit height, range from tens of ms in the case of LEO to several hundreds of ms for GEO. For comparison, the round-trip delays in a cellular network are limited to 1 ms.\n",
      "\n",
      "To handle the large RTT in a NR based NTN, one technique is to equip each device with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. The GNSS receiver enables a device to estimate its position and the universal time (UTC). The UE can also be pre-loaded (and updated when necessary) with the ephemeris of the satellite constellation which can be theoretical or actual, and feeder link delay information. The GNSS equipped UE can compute the position and motion of the possible serving satellites to determine the propagation delay (and delay variation, Doppler shift and variation rate, etc.). In addition to position and time, the velocity of the device can be obtained by measuring the Doppler shift of the GPS signal, or by measuring the variation of the position over an extended period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A communication satellite typically generates several beams over a given area. The footprint of a beam is usually in an elliptic shape, which traditionally is referred to as a cell. The footprint of a beam may also be referred to as a spotbeam. The footprint of a beam may move over the earth's surface with the satellite movement or may be earth fixed with some beam pointing mechanism used by the satellite to compensate for its motion. The size of a spotbeam depends on the system design, which may range from tens of kilometers to a few thousands of kilometers.\n",
      "\n",
      "FIG.1is a block diagram illustrating an example architecture of a satellite network with bent pipe transponders. Base station160is located on earth behind satellite gateway12. Satellite gateway12transmits a signal from base station160over the feeder link to satellite14. Satellite14operates as a repeater forwarding the feeder link signal to the access link to wireless device110. Signals are transmitted for wireless device110to base station160in the reverse directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NTN beam may in comparison to the beams observed in a terrestrial network be very wide and cover an area outside of the area defined by the served cell. Beams covering adjacent cells will overlap and make idle and connected mode mobility based on received signal strength (RSRP) measurements challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "A GNSS receiver determines the travel time of a signal from a satellite by comparing the pseudo random code the receiver generates with an identical code in the signal from the satellite. The receiver “slides” its code later and later in time until it synchronizes with the satellite's code. The amount that the GNSS receiver must slide the code is equal to the signal's travel time. The code measurements are precise to a meter level accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carrier phase measurement is a measure of the range between a satellite and receiver expressed in units of cycles of the carrier frequency. This measurement can be made with very high precision (of the order of millimeters), but the whole number of cycles between satellite and receiver is not measurable. Therefore, the device needs assistance information from a reference ground station with known location in the vicinity of the device. Combining information from a reference ground station and carrier phase measurements can improve the GNSS location to a centimeter accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cell ranking R in a NR, NB-IoT or LTE network is based on RSRP measurement quantity. For example, the cell-ranking criterion Rsfor serving cell in NR is given by\n",
      "\n",
      "Rs=Qm⁢eas,s+Qhyst-Qoffsettemp\n",
      "\n",
      "where Qmeas,sis the RSRP measurement quantity for serving cell, Qhystspecifies the hysteresis value for ranking criteria, and Qoffsettempspecifies the additional offset to be used for cell selection and reselection. It is temporarily used in case the RRC Connection Establishment fails on the cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cell-ranking criterion Rnfor a neighboring cell in NR is given by\n",
      "\n",
      "Rn=Qm⁢e⁢a⁢s,n-Qoffset-Qoffsettemp\n",
      "\n",
      "where Qmeas,nis the RSRP measurement quantity for neighboring cell, and Qoffset specifies the additional offset. For intra-frequency, if Qoffsets,nthat specifies the offset between the two cells is valid, Qoffset is equal to Qoffsets,n; otherwise, Qoffset is equal to zero. For inter-frequency, if Qoffsets,nis valid, Qoffset is equal to Qoffsets,n+Qoffsetfrequencywhere Qoffsetfrequencyspecifies specific offset for equal priority NR frequencies; otherwise, Qoffset is equal to Qoffsetfrequency. A UE uses the R values to rank all cells that fulfill the cell selection criterion and perform cell reselection to the highest ranked cell (unless the cell is found to be not-suitable).\n",
      "\n",
      "To better support multi-beam operations in NR cells, a UE can measure RSRP quantities for all synchronization signal block (SSB) beams in an NR cell. If nrofSS-BlocksToAverage and absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation are configured and the highest SSB beam measurement quantity value is larger than absThreshSS-Blocks Consolidation, the cell measurement quantity is the linear average of the power values of up to nrofSS-BlocksToAverage of highest beam measurement quantity values above absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation. Otherwise, the RSRP measurement quantity for the highest SSB beam is used as the measurement quantity of the corresponding cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "For cell reselection, if rangeToBestCell is configured, among the cells whose R value is within rangeToBestCell of the R value of the highest ranked cell, the UE performs cell reselection to the cell that has the highest number of beams above the threshold absThreshSS-Blocks Consolidation. If multiple cells tie, the UE performs cell reselection to the highest ranked cell among the multiple cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be advantageous for devices in NTN to use location-based mobility. A device equipped with a GNSS receiver may, instead of using RSRP measurements for mobility, base its mobility on its geographical position relative to a set of well-defined geographical positions, such as corresponding to the cell centers in the NTN, or other examples as described with respect toFIG.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "FIG.2illustrates reference locations associated with a spot beam (e.g., cell centers). The horizontal axis represents longitude and the vertical axis represents latitude. UE110is illustrated at a geographical position with respect to cell centers P1, P2, P3, P4and P5.\n",
      "\n",
      "There currently exist certain challenges. For conventional cell reselection, a UE performs a ranking of neighboring cells and selects to the highest ranked cell. The ranking is often performed based on measured signal strength assisted by a prioritization among the neighboring cells. Thus, 3GPP systems base the cell reselection ranking metric on signal strength measurements and do not consider NTN specific aspects. One aspect is that RSRP measurements across a set of multiple cells in an NTN network may display limited signal level variations because of the geometry in satellite networks as well as the slow signal drop-off in spotbeam antenna patterns. This makes it difficult to base a reliable cell reselection ranking entirely on RSRP.\n",
